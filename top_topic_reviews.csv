4,"I have now tried both the Ocean Fish and Tuna and the Duck and Chicken variety of this food.  My cat seems to prefer the taste of the duck and chicken a little better, but I will probably rotate them both because of the health benefits he's gotten (especially from the ocean fish and tuna) that have included a softer coat and less scratching and biting of himself and shedding.  Also, with this food, he doesn't drink much water, but still goes potty alot, so I feel good that he's getting plenty of fluids in his diet.  My only complaint with this brand, and why I only give it 4 stars, is that it has little pieces of potato? and whole peas in it, which my cat eats around and ends up being wasteful, which I don't like given the price.  Not that big of a deal, but it is a minor inconvenience that I have to clean leftover bits out after each feeding as opposed to just washing his empty bowl daily.  (In case you are wondering, it is approximately 4 to 6 whole pea/1.5 pea size potato? bits per 1/4 to 1/2 can.)"
2,"The Happy Baby Beef Stew was not much of a beef stew.  The second ingredient behind water was tomatoes and it was evident in the taste of the product.  It didn't seem to have even a trace taste of beef.  Because of the high tomato content, the stew was very acidic.  I was a bit disappointed by this product."
0,"Light, sweet and oh so good is how I would describe this tea. I first had it at a hotel at the complimentary breakfast and loved it so much, I went to Amazon and ordered more that same day."
3,I finally found a hot cocoa for the keurig that isn't too sweet. I made a cup the day it came in the mail and from the first sip I was hooked. From now on this will be the only hot cocoa I drink.
1,"I have always been somewhat of a soda aficionado since the days of Pepsi, Dr pepper etc. My grandparents owned a little corner grocery store so I'd get to try some of the new sodas that came out.  I really enjoyed Switch Soda .its something different. Taking juice, putting some carbonation in it. Almost in a vague way reminds me of those sparkling grape juice drinks you get around the holidays if you don't drink wine. Its very good. I would definitely buy it again. However the no sugar added part can be a bit ""misleading"" as you as the label states 33 grams per serving but it's only one serving per can but us diabetics should probably only drink this when we have low sugars like I just did bonus is no high fructose corn syrup which isn't very good anyhow. I liked this and would buy more to keep around the house the days I have my sugar lows as It didn't seem to be to overpowering to me. I liked the kiwi,berry as I am a fan of strawberry and kiwi both. I thought personally it was a very interesting soft drink . I really like this infusion stuff they have these days like Dr pepper put  cherry. chocolate diet one year ago and such. Switch kind if is like that. I personally prefer a fruited flavored carbonated beverage anyhow over say a plain cola type flavored one. I thought this was a change from the regular diet Pepsi and diet sierra mist i am used to drinking .I would pick these up if i seen them in a market or on here someday.  Only con I can really think of at the moment for a case off here its 22 bucks that is kinda steep for the economy were living in right now but if they sold them individual it be easier on the pocket book or pick one up in a store now and then when I see it. I really enjoyed the blends of the fruit flavor and the carbonation, like I mentioned it was really good and something different. I would definitely try this again."
0,"This product says that it contains Kava Kava to help with it's calm tea, but there is no Kava in it.  This is confirmed by the tea box set as well as Yogi Tea website.  I just thought I would make anyone else aware in case they were looking for a little supplemental Kava for their tea, but don't want the other Yogi tea with Kava in it."
3,"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this chocolate--too heavily spiced and too sweet; not enough of that velvety, smooth pure chocolate that I prefer. I have 4 tins that I will give away to friends and family.  I'll be back and will let you know how they like it."
1,"Switch kiwi berry is very sweet, heavily flavored (almost overpoweringly so), and is lightly carbonated.  My husband said it was good, he'd drink it if it was free, but he wouldn't go out to buy it.  I'd say the same.  It was okay.<br /><br />I could taste a lot of grape flavoring that lingers along with a touch of apple.  I might even taste a tiny bit of kiwi, but I wouldn't describe the flavor as kiwi berry -- more like grape apple.<br /><br />Switch is too syrupy for me.  I'd prefer something more light and crisp."
4,"We started buying 100% meat diets on our vet's recommendation for getting our big fatty to lose weight on a ""catkins"" diet.  Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved.  The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better.  They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey.  We mix in some Wysong ""Call of the Wild"" into the meat.<br /><br />Surprisingly, they love quail.  Far more than chicken, and a bit more than turkey.  My understanding is that cats naturally eat small fowl and rodents, so quail is actually the closest to what they actually eat in the wild."
0,i got this tea hoping it would be better than my dieters delight china slim tea but it isnt. it does make you use the bathroom but not enough for you to feel cleansed for that particular day...i have no choice but to finish thus package but i will be going back to my regular tea afterwards
2,"This is excellent for a baby's first taste. The pouch size is perfect and it actually lasted me two days, as my baby is still just learning to eat solids, therefore didn't have it all. The top makes it easy to refasten, so it doesn't go to waste and can be used again. I love the pouch, it's easy to get all the product out wihtout making a mess."
0,"This was the first revolution tea flavor I ever tried, and it made me fall in love with the brand.  Having tried about half of revolution tea's line, I'd rate my favorites in order > Acai Green > Tropical green > Chocolate Orange Green > White Pear > Sweet Ginger Peach.  I'm more of a green and white tea fan, though, so your experience may differ."
2,"I make a lot of my own baby food, but was not about to make a meat baby food. After buying a few different purees, I tried Chick Chick.  My fussy 9 month old LOVED it instantly. I don't know if it is the flavor or the texture (nice with some small bits in it), but she gobbles it down.  It is worth the price (especially if you do subscribe and save) and I am pleased that she is getting a high quality protein meal and I don't have to puree chicken!"
0,Great tasting tea I have been looking for a good  Sassafras tea forever.Finally. I will be ordering this product again .<br />Thanks Kim:D
2,"My little one loves froose! It's expensive at our grocery store, $4 for a 4 pack. We use it sparingly. If our little one wakes up too early and has already nursed, he'll have a froose and go back to sleep. When he was sick, it was the only liquid other than nursing that I could get in him. I buy the pear flavor because it has less sugar than the others by froose. I like that it is more nourishing and substantial than other juices. It is thicker and ""syrupy"", but that's not a problem unless you have a box squeezer. That could be solved by placing the juice box in a small cup. Someone taught me this trick. :)<br />Love pear froose!"
4,"My cat will only eat the Whiskas Choice cuts with beef.  My local stores quit carrying this product and I bought any cat food similar to it, regardles of price.  My cat ate only dry food for two months or more.  He lost weight that he can't afford to lose. I am so happy that I found this Whiskas item on Amazon."
4,"Of course, nobody can ever figure out what cats will like, but our experience is the opposite of the one-star review.<br /><br />Our two Bengal cats ate kibble for years, but after some serious teeth problems, they had to switch to canned food. We tried a few different brands and flavors. They'd eat it for a few days, then turn up their noses. Even expensive food from the vet's did not please them.<br /><br />So, we tried the Friskies Sea Captains Choice flavor, and they went nuts, gobbling it down like candy. We only bought a few cans at a time, figuring they would tire of it, but no, they have been eating it with gusto for a coupe of months now, so we buy it by the case.<br /><br />I don't understand about it not smelling good; perhaps they got a bad batch, but it smells like other cat foods to us, and the pate is easy to dish out. As long as the cats love it, who are we to complain?"
0,I love this tea.  I have issues with added flowers and flavorings in other teas and Revolution teas tell you exactly whats in it and there are no additives!  I have been ordering from them ever since my first box of tea.  I take it to the office and I have a travel container and take it with me to restaurants.
2,"I purchased the baby white by accident.  We usually get the medium white, which is great.  The baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it."
1,"A nice juice drink, but it just didn't grab me like other flavors did. I would probably not purchase it in the future, though I did not dislike it. Like I said, it just didn't grab me."
0,"The best tea for ice tea.  A little harder to use than bags, but the taste is so much better.  I make mine in an ice tea pot and it's always perfect.  I've been drinking it all my life and the quality is always wonderful."
3,"My husband and I really like this cocoa.  I add extra milk to my cup for a creamier flavor, but the convenience cannot be beat."
4,"I am trying to feed our two new (to us)kitties healthy cat foods and have tried a few varieties.  The cats prefer Before Grain and Wellness.  They wouldn't touch Spot's Stew.  One cat prefers fishy foods and the other fowl.  We have tried the turkey and Beef (I ordered Bison, but upon looking at the ingredients listed at [...] they listed only beef and my cans arrived labeled BEEF).<br />I think they liked the Beef a little better.  I admit, it smells better than most cat foods.  They prefer it at room temp.<br />The reason I listed the lack of fiber is that one of the cats has taken to ripping up the carpet with his teeth!  I have read that it may be an indication that he needs more fiber. (The cats were declawed by their previous owners- not us.)<br />Both cats were a little over weight when we adopted them.  One seems a bit slimmer now, the other, I'm not sure.<br />I do recommend the foods.  Even with the seemingly high cost, this is MUCH cheaper per ounce than the Whiskaa pouches we used to buy for our late kitty and has no by-products."
1,"I tried two flavors of Switch; the Orange Tangerine and the Watermelon Strawberry. I liked the watermelon flavor a lot, but found that with Orange Tangerine, the flavor of the can came through a bit too much. It reminded me of why I've never really enjoyed drinking canned orange juice. Still, it was fairly good and the carbonation made it light and refreshing. Both flavors were a big, big hit with my 8 year-old son."
1,"Like the SWITCH beverage I previously reviewed, this is a moderately tasty drink.  The balance of the carbonation and the fruit juice is decent enough, giving more of a tickle to the tongue than the rush of bubbles that soda usually gives.  It's definitely a lot more like juice than soda, which goes against its purpose of being a replacement for soda.  Overall, it's pretty drinkable, but I would never seek this beverage out.  There are better juices, and there are better sodas.<br /><br />One major plus, though, was that it wasn't as thick and syrupy as the Watermelon/Strawberry SWITCH.<br /><br />6/10"
0,"I read many of the reviews and had mixed feelings about this product. I am glad I decided to purchase it anyway. The tea definitely cleanses you inside and out IF you follow the packaging instructions. Plus, it tastes great. I will continue to purchase more when my supply runs low."
0,"This is a pleasant tea, it tastes mostly of chamomile.  Unfortunately for me, it doesn't do too much to squelch heartburn.  I'm now 36 weeks along and have had heartburn almost the whole time, and I was hoping this would help out but it really hasn't had an effect. I do like the tea just as a mild beverage, but I can't recommend it for pregnancy related heartburn."
0,"You will not find a better loose green tea for the price.  I was able to get free shipping as well since I bought it with something else that totaled over $25.  This is the tea used by many Japanese people.  Do not fall for those high-priced ""organic"" green teas produced by American companies.  They are good...but you are not getting anything better than Hime Ban Cha Tea."
2,"Organic, and loaded with calories, fat and protein, this the ONLY baby food with meat that my picky little one will happily eat.  I've found that very few groceries carry this near my home (and I live in metropolitan Seattle) and so I've resorted to ordering it by the case from Amazon.  The free 2 day shipping Rocks!"
2,"My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein, and try upping the fish. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien, and were salmon.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon."
1,"I tried this Root beer for the first time about a week ago. I had been drinking Zevia Root Beer (which is really good, too), but decided to start buying this brand, instead. I love the taste of both, but this one has a creamy taste to it which I prefer. I was so glad to find sugar-free sodas that didn't have all those nasty artificial sweeteners in them!! I highly recommend Blue Sky Free (and Zevia, as well). Oh, and the Blue Sky Free Cherry Vanilla Creme is awesome!! The only ones I don't personally recommend are the colas in either Zevia or Blue Sky free brand.. they are bleh, but that's just me."
2,My baby loves Rice and Lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat.  If we are going somewhere I won't be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold.
2,"Kids love it, Mom & I love it, and even the dog loves it!  Whether it's for breakfast or just munching on a couple of handfuls for a snack, Cinnamon Life satisfies the hunger crave in all of us!  The sweet cinnamon taste seems to really appeal to breakfast cereal eaters alike.  The only slight complaint I have is it gets soggy really fast, so I try not to put a lot of milk on my cereal."
1,"So I let my girls drink this and tell me what they thought. They loved it, hand down. I liked it also and would like to grab more. The label says no artificial sugars and 100% juice. If thats true its great - it is very sweet tasting and very very flavorful. The carbonation adds a nice kick also."
4,"I finally did the research on this temptation treats and I'm glad to see that my suspicions are correct. I have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting. Ironically, I even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting. Now is official, I stopped giving them to him as often, and then monitored him whenever I gave him any. It soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever I give him this treats. Sometimes he would vomit within minutes, and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning, but if I give him this treats, I'm sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after.  I think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients, and they probably don't do anything to other cats but I'm never buying this again for my kitty."
0,"A friend who'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago. Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound. At $7/lb. in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant, I think it's great. I've been drinking Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Lapsang Souchong, Assam, etc. Most of them were over $30/lb. with shipping. Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest. Has everything I'm looking for in a strong, full-bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring. My current favorite afternoon tea. Unless you're extremely jaded or a tea snob, you'll love it."
1,"I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.<br /><br />The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.<br /><br />What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money."
0,"Our Minneapolis Indian shops stopped selling Darjeeling tea over a year ago. I love this tea as it tastes like the stuff I grew up drinking in England, altho I drink this black, no sugar.<br /><br />A year ago, I bought a couple of pounds online for $15/pound including shipping. I have done a lot of searching to find out why Darjeeling has seemingly disappeared. The Indian grocers are mystified, and online there is no clue. Apparently, green label Darjeeling is Lipton's most popular tea. Hard to believe if people can't actually purchase it. The name changed from Lipton Green Label to Lipton Finest Darjeeling.<br /><br />iShopIndian has 250g for $6.99 but have a flat shipping fee of $10, so one would want to buy several boxes. I have not bought through this vendor, but I plan to.<br /><br />I have a friend visiting India and hope she will find room in her suitcase to bring me back a pound (or 3). I plan to ask if there is a shortage in India.<br />Good luck finding this tea at an affordable price!"
1,"In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself. But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water? Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C"">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G"">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40"">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used. Fruit Punch, Orange Tangerine, and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest calories, 140; Kiwi Berry is next, 135; Black Cherry is next, 130; and Grape has the lowest, 125.  Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.<br /><br />Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice. All contain acerola, apple, and grape juice. In addition to their title juices Kiwi Berry contains raspberry and strawberry, and Fruit Punch contains cherry, lemon, and pineapple.  Orange Tangerine also contains soy.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  The difference? The Izze products are fortified with vitamins: B6 and Niacin in addition to C and have roughly three fifths the calories, total carbohydrates, and sugars of The Switch products."
0,"Lipton does taste good but it's not a good quality tea! If you open the tea bag you'll see their not tea leaves but tea dust (cheep). Even the loos lipton tea is described as being ""broken down so you need a fine filter to strain it."" When you steep good tea it should unfurl and look like spinach!<br /><br />They say this tea comes to $0.57 an oz?!?!?! Lets do the math. $27.54 devided by 8oz = $3.44.<br />I buy my tea from Set to a Tea [...]). It's really good tea with flavoring and dried fruit pices. It comes to $3 an oz for a tin or $2.57 for a refill. Weather you buy it loose or in bags you get the same quality tea! I went to a tea party last year (like a tupperware party but more fun) where the chick told us all about the different kinds of tea and gave us samples."
1,"I always liked Orange Crush when I was a kid.  Sure, it was just sugar water with some flavoring, but it was really good flavoring...except it had a chemical whang and an aftertaste that you just had to accept.<br /><br />Well, no more.  Switch Orange Tangerine drink is NOT sugar water.  It's 100% juice, the good stuff, and it's lightly carbonated, not overcarbonated like those sugary soft drinks either.  And no chemical whang!  And no aftertaste!<br /><br />Vitamin C and no added sugar?  I'll take that.  Of course there's sugar content, but it's just the natural sugar that comes in the juice.  Why didn't people think of this stuff when I was a kid?"
3,I just bought a six-pack of Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa mix.  It's pretty good for the price.  My favorite will always be Ghirardelli -- but this does the trick in a pinch.
1,Was looking forward to this drink but was put off by its sweet soda-like taste.  Maybe it's an acquired taste? I'm not sure  but the high calories don't make me want to try.  Looking forward to a diet version.
2,Baby loves to feed herself and these are a great on the go option. We have tried other brands (Gerber) but this is her favorite by far and I don't feel bad giving them to her as I know that they are high quality. Hubby tries to steal a few away here and there as well :)
3,some of the best chocolates i ever tasted. If you are a chocolates lover then you have to try these
1,"Out of all the No Calorie Sweeteners I have tried, I must say that this is the best!  To me, it tastes as close to real sugar as you can get.  I don't drink diet soda or anything artificially sweetened because of the taste. I did not experience gas or bloating from this product as I did with some other sweeteners.  For some reason they have taken this off the supermarket shelves in my state of NJ.  Did find in another state under the store name.  So glad that I can purchase this on Amazon!"
1,"Excellent Pine Apple Juice, but the price is higher on Amazon . Whole Foods sells the lakewood Pine Apple Juice at $5.49 and when on sale  $ 4.49 compared to the Amazon Price of $6.99. No reason for a $1.50 per bottle Price Difference"
2,"I love these foods my first son devoured them happily and now my second son also loves them. This fruit mix has a great variety my sons both love the peach oatmeal banana best. Overall a great product high quality ingredients and they don't taste half bad, I of course had to try them if my boys loved them."
3,I like the rich dark smooth taste of the Grove Square cocoa. It is the best I have found in K-cups and I have been on auto delivery for at least a few months now. Delicious!
3,"The hot chocolate is my husband's favorite.  Service was also great, as it usually is.  Very popular now with winter coming on."
0,Very pretty to drop a few rose buds in a cup of tea but found it to have disappointedly weak rose flavor as a tea itself.<br />Perhaps the other rose teas I've had were infused with flavoring. Not sure.
2,I have to give it to the makers of this line of organic baby food. This stuff is obviously high quality. It smells very fishy even though salmon is not one of the first listed ingredients. Again I was surprised but my little guy wolfed it down repeatedly. I was happy to find an organic fish food for my baby. Thumbs up.
0,"I've always enjoyed a good cup of Earl Grey (especially when coupled with a good book) but have not really gotten loose leaf before. This Rishi Earl Grey is very nice, not overly heavy with no licorice undertones that I really find unappealing in some Earl Gery varieties. The tea takes four minutes to steep, and when done is quite aromatic. I would recommend this one without reservation.<br /><br />*****Update 10-10-2009*****<br /><br />I had to come update this review to express how much I LOVE this tea. It's easily one of the most enjoyable teas I've experienced (I'm drinking a cup of it as I update this review) and it always makes me happy when I brew a cup. This is a lovely tea!"
0,The vendor is fast and dependable. The tea is simply the best way to relax and great tasting too. Highly recommend !!
0,"I've been drinking other brands of black tea, but I'm going to switch to this one. Other English Breakfast mixes taste like strong black tea. Good, but not worth writing about. This one tastes like ... I can't put names to all the things happening in my mouth; but I know the blend is worth every penny."
1,"I'm not a fan of messy gels, or stopping for PowerAde during a race. When I do my own long runs or if I'm doing a half, mess and inconvenience factor aside I also don't want to consume junk. These are organic and contain honey, and while soft & squishy somehow don't get stuck to each other when shoved in a gel pocket during a run. The taste is so delicious that my son tries to swipe them as well!"
1,"It has a nice taste.  Good for sipping.  If you drink soda or juice with your meals, this would be a decent alternative.  The tangerine taste is pronounced but not overpowering.  The carbonation is pleasant.<br /><br />However, it's not a drink I would normally imbibe.  I normally drink either water or beverages sweetened with something other than sugar.  And this has a LOAD of sugar.  Yes, they say it has no added sugar.  That's probably accurate.  But the natural sugar in the apple/tangerine/orange juices in this drink adds up to 34 grams.  Compare that to the same amount of Coke at 27 grams!  I checked a few other tangerine flavored sodas - they all had similar amounts of sugar as Switch.  I suppose tangerines are loaded with sugar.  Anyway, that's a lot more sugar than I normally drink.<br /><br />If the sugar isn't an issue, this is worth checking out."
4,"I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his ""spunk"" so I decided it was time to start buying him ""real"" cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals!"
0,"I was pretty skeptical that this tea could actually do anything for my ""winter stuffies"" but I really don't like the idea of over-medicating myself with prescriptions and otc drugs either, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Imagine my pleased surprise to find out this tea is both a soothing drinking experience and also...actually works! It has a nice, herby taste and not over-licoricey at all (which I feared, not being a fan.) Really nice with a drop of honey. And then, amazingly enough, my nose and lungs feel open and clear for hours after drinking this tea. One cup, and I ran back to my computer to order a subscription!"
3,"This hot chocolate is great am so glad I doubled the order ,you can not miss with this .Now I have quick hot chocolate for the kids and grandkids"
3,"When I got my Keurig brewer last month, I bought two different types of hot chocolate.  The Grove Square Hot Chocolate is far superior.  I have so far brewed it on 6oz and 8oz with good flavor at both sizes.  The flavor is rich and it leaves no residue in the bottom of the kcup (the other brand does, maybe I got a bad batch?).  Overall, I will happily buy this one again."
3,"These are the only kind of cocoa k-cups I have tried, as I have a fairly new machine. My only complaint is that it seems like the taste of chocolate in the milk chocolate version needs a bit of a boost. However, I usually add another teaspoon of regular cocoa mix and the taste is great. The peppermint and dark chocolate k-cups are delicious. Definitely worth a shot for this great price!"
1,"""Switch `Orange Tangerine'"" is advertized as 100% juice with carbonation.  They were accurate as far as the 100% juice and (light) carbonation goes, but imagine my disappointment when I checked the ingredients, and I read the following: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice concentrates)...<br /><br />BTW - acerola is also known by the common names Barbados cherry and wild crapemyrtle. It's a berry that has extremely high amounts of Vit C.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the drink.  When I ordered this item I was expecting a carbonated ""orange tangerine"" drink, but that was not the taste I got.  After all, tangerine and orange are present in smaller amounts than grape and apple juices.  As a result this drink had a flavor more like a mixture of sparkling grape and sparking apple combined, with somewhat of a light citrus twist, but less carbonation than either sparkling grape or sparkling apple have.<br /><br />The overall flavor of ""Switch"" was all right, but it was not, in my opinion ""orange tangerine"" at all.  In that respect this drink was a great disappointment.  The manufacturer would have been more accurate to name this drink ""fruit punch"" or ""fruit cocktail"" or perhaps ""grape-apple"".  There is, by the way, already a ""fruit punch"" version...I wonder what's in that flavor that's not in this one?<br /><br />The can size is just adequate at 8.3 oz, but is, I would say, fairly expensive at nearly $1/can, especially when it's not what you thought you were getting.<br /><br />The drink does, to its credit, have 100% of the recommended daily amount of Vit C, and has only natural juices in it.  That is probably true, but...THIS IS NOT A DIET DRINK.  Just because the can says ""no sugar added"", that doesn't mean that there's no sugar in it.  There happens to be a significant amount of sugar in this drink (given the total volume you get/can)...if I recall correctly the contents label said 35g of sugar.  That's because 100% fruit juice is loaded with sugar, sugar like fructose.<br /><br />OK, frankly, the taste combo doesn't particularly appeal to me, that's why I didn't order the grape version of this product, and now that I know what's in the ""orange tangerine"" I wouldn't order it again.<br /><br />I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars though, simply because it's not really an orange-tangerine drink as advertized.  I guess I'll have to go with 2 stars.  (I don't know why 3 stars showed up for this product!?)  Alas..."
0,"I go along with a number of reviewers that this isn't a very strong tea.  It has a nice mild malty taste that holds up to milk and sugar but if you try to get it to a strong malty taste it gets bitter.  But the price is good, it comes with rapid Amazon shipping, and it is better than anything from the grocery store.  And it is organic.  So, overall, I'm good with it.  For a bit more though you can get a stronger malty organic tea from one of the other on-line bulk tea stores."
0,"Same great taste as the honeybush tea bags, but so much more green!  Thank you for packaging this in bulk!"
1,"I love cherry soda, but this product is the best cherry soda  that I have ever tasted.  Sweet and slightly tart at one and the same time.  Try it once, and you will be hooked for good."
4,"We have two cats and four dogs. The cats seemed to like this treat but the dogs turned up their noses at it. One of them, a Chiweenee, eats just about everything and he would not touch it. He tried it and left it laying on the floor."
0,I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try.
0,Awesome tasting Tea in a 16 oz. can!  I highly recommend this product because it taste great and doesn't cost a lot.
1,"I usually find the citrus sodas too tart/acidic for my tastes, and I find the black cherry Fresca too cloyingly sweet. I LOVE the peach; it's so crisp and refreshing without being acidic, and is just the right sweet for me. Other than ginger ale, it's my favorite ""white"" soda. I have been having trouble finding this in the grocery, and really hope it hasn't been discontinued."
4,"I honestly have to say that I just won't buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one."
2,"What a GREAT idea!!!! My daughter love it.<br />I don't think is difficult to wash, I mean, is not like just toss water and that's it... but, come on!!!!<br />Absolutely recommend it!"
0,"Classic Assam Estate tea, malty, full-bodied, medium-strength organic black tea with a slightly sweet aroma and aftertaste (clearly a second flush offering; the first flush pickings have a Darjeeling-like astringency).  Very drinkable by as is, but does very nicely with a spot of milk.  I will purchase this tea again.  Highly recommended."
0,I found Davidson's Banaspaty Estate Assam tea to be a very good Assam at a very reasonable price. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I've had better but at more than twice the price. Davidson's is the hands-down winner on value. This is the second time I've purchased it and I intend to buy more in the future.
2,"I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon.  The Raincoast Trading Co. salmon is very tasty, equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland.  However, the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition, the Kirkland cans were dented badly.  I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon."
1,"The Switch Orange Tangerine soda is an attempt to made a fruit soda with real fruit juice, real fruit flavor, and no added sugar.  They have mostly succeeded.  In the glass, the Switch looks like juice.  It is lightly but distinctly carbonated and easy to drink.  The orange and tangerine flavors are true - none of the ""burn"" of fake orange flavor.  The hit of tangerine is really nice and I greatly enjoyed the flavor.  My problem with the Switch was that it was too sweet for my taste.  I was surprised at the how sweet it was given the advertised ""no added sugar"".  The ingredient list mentions grape and apple juice concentrates.  That's how they get the sugars in without adding sugar.  Fruit juice concentrates are loaded with natural fruit sugars.  The nutritional label tells the story:  the 8.3 oz can has 34 grams of sugar!  That's more than Cocoa Cola (27 grams per 8 oz).  Bottom line - this is just too sweet for me.  It's too bad because the flavors are awesome.  If you have a sweet tooth, maybe this is for you."
0,Now let me start by saying I did not buy this tea as a diet supplement. I bought this because I tried it from a local store as I was looking for a tea that had some peppermint in it but not so much it was over-powering like a full peppermint tea. This has just the right amount of peppermint combined with a green tea. Overall it is a pleasant taste that I could drink all day.
1,"I quit sodas over a year ago due to the unhealthiness of them.  I do, however, like bubbly drinks, but I don't need the sugar or sodium.  That's why this product is perfect.  It is 100% fruit juice, carbonated for the bubbliness.<br /><br />Orange is one of my favorite flavors.  This drink is the perfect drink.<br /><br />I think this product is even better than orange soda; orange soda is sticky, but this product is not.  It has the perfect amount of sharpness - which I love.  Because it is 100% fruit juice, it also has the perfect amount of natural sweetness.<br /><br />So this product is all the good things rolled into one:<br /><br />100% fruit juice<br />No added sugar<br />Bubbly<br />Awesome orange flavor<br /><br />It's so good, it's hard to believe you're drinking something healthy."
3,"This hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. Although, even the sugary taste is weak, and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. The consistency is watery and bland. This is when I made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product."
3,"As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone."
1,"This carbonated 100% juice drink tastes incredibly good! It reminds me of eating fresh tangerines when I was a kid, yet this is a drinkable version of that! If you like oranges and tangerines, you'll love this! These ought to be in every school vending machine (instead of sodas!)<br /><br />This is made from 100% juice, so great for adult (Or kids') lunches, picnics, etc. A great drink for exercise as well, and doesn't have the sugar in it, so no spikes in blood sugar... Likely a good choice for diabetics as well, and without the artificial sweeteners!"
3,"I have been making hot chocolate w Abuelita for years. I have found that if I heat a tablet(in its paper) in the microwave, i can spoon in a softer mostly melted mix that does not require a blender or diminish the flavor. You may want to start at about 30 secs and warm more as needed."
2,"Belle's Biscuits are fantastic.  My eight-month old granddaughter LOVES them.  They are safe and really ease her teething discomfort.  We freeze them to extend their shelf life and she enjoys them right out of the freezer.  Prepare for a mess, though; after an hour gumming these delicious biscuits she and her seat need a thorough washing!  The only thing that would make them better is if they were eligible for free Prime shipping!"
0,I love this green tea.  It is a good price for my use with my Tassimo machine.
1,"I didn't really like the taste of this product much.  It has an artificial taste to me, even though it is juice and water.  It is a carbonated drink and it somewhat reminded me of the taste of baby aspirin, although not quite that bad.  I did drink the whole can.  The 8.3 oz can is narrow, compared to the 12 oz soda can you are used to seeing.<br /><br />The can says it is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all natural with no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and gluten free.  The nutrition box indicates (for the entire 8.3 oz can) 15mg sodium, 36g carbs, 34 g sugar, Vitamin C 100 %, Vitamin A 20%.<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows and are listed in the following order: 100% juice (filtering sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates), gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). Contains soy. (First ingredient listed is supposed to be the one there is the most of.)<br /><br />You may wonder why I spent so much time on the ingredients.  Well, if you don't read labels, you really should start.  Some products may taste really good but may be full of nasty things you really do not want your children to eat (or yourself).  The term, gluten free, for example is VERY important to those who have gluten intolerance.<br /><br />Kudos to the manufacturer for making a healthier product and I would have liked to have given this flavor a better review, but the taste was not there for me.  The black cherry flavor has a lot better taste.<br /><br />Still, if you are looking for a seemingly healthier beverage to pack in your child's lunch, this could be worth a try.  Think of it as a flavored carbonated water.  I gave it 3 stars because it is not unhealthy and it is not bad - just not something I like the taste of.<br /><br />I would sooner put this product in a child's lunch than a soda.  My daddy used to put soda on the car's battery terminals to dissolve the acid :-("
0,"Sleepytime tea is one of those teas that can always be counted on. It's very mellow, with a great taste and smell. Perfect for relaxing after a long day. This is the tea that all other herbal teas should be measured against."
2,"Unfortunately they changed the recipe up on our baby....he looooooved this, it was a great trainer food as it was thicker now it's just runy like the chick chick one which we stopped buying.  One taste of the new formula and baby turned up his nose and didn't want anymore....I was presistant and eventually the only way he'll eat it is with bread dipped in it or his veggie stix dipped in it and I have to sneak in spoonfulls here and there.  It's just too runny for our baby boy now, he's older now but we still want to make sure he's getting salmon atleast once a week.  This is the most convenient for us so we still give it to him at 20 months.  I'm going to hunt down the original forumla's and stock up whenever I see them!  Other than that, we are a 100% HappyBaby family and love all the wonderful products they continue to make!"
1,"With all of the choices of things to drink, this is an excellent one. It tastes great. Most of our choices are either loaded with sugar, or carbonated ... even milk is sugar-dense. This drink is good for blood pressure and cholesterol. It is an excellent thirst-quencher. So much better for the hot summer months than sugary lemonade! It does, however acidify the pH. I am supposed to be alkalizing my diet, so I can't drink a lot of this. :(<br /><br />From the time I was a small child, my mother was an advocate of apple cider vinegar and honey for health. Hippocrates would have been happy to discover Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar All Natural Drink: Concord Grape Acai :))) Try it and drink to good health!"
0,The teas seem to brew really strong so use a large glass or dilute after... Unless you really like strong tea.<br /><br />It's a good pack to figure out which flavors you want to buy in bulk.
4,"We recently adopted a new kitten. We rotate Felidae grain-free canned formula with Wellness Turkey canned food. He loves both and eats well, he's never left a single whole pea behind. This is a very high-quality cat food, using excellent all-meat proteins. He is healthy, active,affectionate, and has a smooth glossy coat. Definitely worth the cost in the long run.<br /><br />I believe it is worthwhile to rotate different (high-quality) canned foods for variety and to not create a cat who will ONLY eat one brand. I think this is useful also in the event of a recall. I'm looking for a 3rd high-quality brand to add to the rotation."
3,"Sure to be a hit with chalk-a-holics everywhere, from first sip to last this product suggests its European heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern France.<br /><br />Some seem to be making a case for it only having 60 calories, but the Keurig Chai Latte only has 70, and that product actually tastes pretty good.<br /><br />I have yet to find a Keurig-compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old Swiss Miss, scooped from a tub or a foil packet. And Swiss Miss isn't that great to begin with, although it sure is cheaper than this stuff.<br /><br />I wonder if the size of the Keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup, so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised."
2,"I gave this flavor to my 6 month old son but he did not like it so I tried to blend it, but still no luck. It does have very strong taste especially for babies who had only veggie and fruit blends. So I mixed the blended beef stew with green beans ( 1,5 oz of beef stew with 3,5oz green beans ) and my baby ate it all no problem. I just think since he did not have any flavor like that before ( tomato, beef, spices ) he just need to get used to the flavor. Sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste. I will keep adding less of the veggie blends and I bet he will get used to the taste in no time. So do not give up if your baby doesn't like it right away. I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.<br />My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.<br /><br />UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.<br />Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.<br />So if you did not have luck first time do not give up, it took couple tries for us and now he loves it."
0,"I got this for my mom and she loved it. She just got a tea maker and with this 3 pack of 8 discs each, she is going to have a lot of tea. I shouldn't have gotton the awake tea for her because it was only 1 package with 7 discs because it is more expensive. Oh well, the thought that counts! Btw if you read this, please check out my seller profile and items i sell. I will star to sell stuff soon and once i talk with amazon i will let everyone choose super saver shipping. I am a true seller and give the customers what they wan't in perfect condition. Anyways, this tea is great and i reccomend this to everyone who loves tea."
1,"We got this in the mail and were eager to try it.  I am a huge fan of Izze Sparkling Juice and figured this would be similar to that.  It was in regards to taste, however.....well, let me break it down.<br /><br />TASTE: I would give it a four!  It had a slight kick to it, that I love.  A little bit of a bitter taste, which my two older boys seemed to like as well.  In fact my 13 year old was bummed when I said we had finished the can.  My husband enjoyed it as well, though I don't see this replacing his daily Dr. Pepper anytime soon.<br /><br />BENEFIT: It is 100% all natural juice, and it has 100% of your DV of Vitamin C.  Certainly a bit better for you than your traditional soda, but it has just as many calories as a LARGER can of Dr. pepper!  So, i fyou are like me and have maybe one carbonated beverage a day, calorie wise you aren't doing yourself any favors by switching to this.  I will stick with my Izze Blackberry.  3 stars.<br /><br />VALUE: 1 1/2 stars, MAYBE 2.  You get 24 8 oz cans for 23 dollars.  Hardly a bargain in today's economic climate.  I like to treat myself occasionally, and a sweet treat is certainly one way I often do that, but 23 dollars for 24 cans of this!  Nope, no way, not happening.<br /><br />Bottom line:  It was tasty, and we enjoyed it, but this isn't something I can see myself buying for my large family.  The benefits just aren't there, not when I can get 100% real fruit juice at the store for 3 dollars a gallon, and add a bit of soda water myself for another buck, if that.  Save your money"
4,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."
1,"I don't like how so many bottled and canned drinks these days (even the low-calorie ones) are so sweet.  This was nicely not-too-sweet, but had a canned, not fresh juice flavor.  It is personal taste, but I didn't care for the 'processed' flavor."
2,"So, for some god-awful reason, I opened one of the care packages I'd received and this was in there. I only ate it on a dare, and I am glad I did. It smells inticing and salty and one taste of it and I was hooked. It has the consistency of cream of wheat, except it felt like small bits of sand, and the beef flavor is just mildly infused. Now I am hooked and will probably order a bunch of it. In fact, I sure hope I'll never have a child, because s/he isn't going to be left with any food. I am eating it all!"
0,I use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies.  Provides you all the health benefits of green tea.  Love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger.
1,"Pop the can and get sensory caress from the orange scent.<br />The taste is pure citrus bliss. Great flavor. I'd say the flavor is halfway between fresh orange juice and really good orange soda. The tangerine is definitely present, but mostly only as a very pleasent after taste.<br /><br />Love it."
0,"The price is right. Organic Tea at a great price, but that's as far as it goes. I've tried about 5 of the Davidsons so far and they just lack character."
2,"My baby loves Happy Baby's Chick Chick meal, so we tried the salmon. It is the first food that my 11 month old has ever spit back at me. I tried to feed him this four different days to see if he would get used to it, or change his mind. No luck. It's too bad that you can only purchase them in lots of 16.... lots of leftover salmon here."
1,"I was really pleasantly surprised with this drink. It's made from 100 percent fruit juices with no added sugar... and still tastes great. I was surprised that it does actually use the juices that describes the flavor. For example, this product actually contains real Kiwi and a blend of different berry juices. It's kind of a rare thing these days (since everything uses artificial flavors and sweeteners now)<br /><br />The only negative thing I can think of to say is that the bottles are too small.. only 8.3 ounces.  I wish they were at least... 10 ounces (preferably 12 :)"
4,It's all natural real food that you can see the difference. My cat loves it so much that now we call him the tiki kitty.
0,I love this TEA. It has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea. I do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but I can live with that. No big deal! The quality of TEA makes up for that.
3,"Lets face it, $11 isn't going to get you the most succulent chocolate in the world.  But it does give you a GREAT everyday cocoa in a 6oz brew. Great to mix with a coffee for an instant mocha, and no sugar needed!  Kids will LOVE it. VERY happy with this purchase.  Will keep this in my pantry always!"
1,"I tried the Switch Kiwi Berry drink along with the Switch Black Cherry drink.  I'll review them together because there isn't that much to write about.<br /><br />First, I'll admit a little bias.  I'm not a fan of sugar-based drinks.  I drink diet pop, Crystal Light drinks, and I use saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose.  I find sugar-based drinks generally ""gummy"", although carbonated drinks are somewhat preferable to non-carbonated drinks.  While there is ""no sugar added"" to these drinks, the fruit juice itself is quite full of sugar.<br /><br />The Switch brand drinks are lightly carbonated, which helps them in my opinion - others may disagree.  The gumminess is still there, though.  The fruit flavor is not strong enough to overcome this and I found that I needed this drink to be extremely cold (as in near frozen) to enjoy it.  I did not like the aluminum can for this product either.  I find that fruit-flavored drinks seem to latch onto the aluminum flavor more than other drinks.<br /><br />My personal preference was for the Black Cherry, but others may like the Kiwi Berry.  I can't recommend this as a net positive, but my preferences might adversely reflect here - I'll rate it as neutral.  If you feel your tastes are similar to mine, you should probably forgo this one."
0,"Tea has a great flavor - almost what I'd call 'spearmint' flavor which is great with honey or sugar with or without cream. I drink it hot and if it does cool, it's still good.  It does help me relax and go to sleep when I've had a long day.  My grandchildren love the flavor and we often share a pot of tea as it is perfectly safe for them.  Celestial Seasoning Teas are great teas always but Sleepytime is one of their classics! I'd recommend this tea to anyone, as out of all of Celestial Seasonings teas, this is probably ranks as close to number one on my list of favorites.  And I do have a lot of their tea in my pantry -- my son swears I must own stock in it, LOL.  If you like tea, try it, I really think you'll be glad you did as I feel Sleepytime truly is one of their best teas. :)"
1,"I'm a big fan of avoiding corn syrup and a lot of the other ingredients that go into most processed foods and beverages these days, so this beverage idea really sounded good to me.  It doesn't contain a bunch of artificial junk in it, and it still tastes pretty good.  I could definitely drink more of these.  They won't ever be my favorite beverage, but then I'm more of a non-carbonated kind of drinker anyway.  This is definitely a good alternative to other products out there, and I'd like to try other flavors as well."
0,"As a fan of English & Irish breakfast teas, I found this tea to be very weak flavored.  If you like milder/weaker teas, this may be for you.  But if you like more robust flavors, steer clear of this one."
0,I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.
0,I have been taking this tea twice per day and I am enjoying the way I feel
1,"Very crisp and refreshing.  if you want real juice but no caffeine and not quite the ridiculous sugar-zap of soda, this is the way to go.  It's spendy which detracts from the overall value, but if it every comes down a little, it really is delicious."
0,This is one of the most delicious teas I have ever encountered.  It is like having dessert ... with a lot less calories!
0,"I was a little hesitent to make a big order for so much tea, not knowing if I would like it.  So I went to a local supermarket and bought a tin there so I might give it a taste test.  This is quite a good green tea.  Other than buying generic green teabags, I usually buy a Bancha tea. This tea is not as grassy, more bold with a slight smokey taste and more of a kickiness to it.<br /><br />The cannisters are nice and their is an inside foil liner to keep the tea fresh.  The only thing to be aware is that this is a lot of tea, altogether 21 ounces divided into six separate cannisters. Unless you really love this tea, plan on making some gifts."
3,"I read all the reviews on every hot chocolate k-cup on the market and decided to try this one first. Its not good. Even on the smallest cup setting it tastes watered down and there is a distinct ""plasticy"" taste. I think that this an inherent problem with all the k-cup hot chocolates. You just can't fit enough chocolate in the cup so that it doesn't taste watered down. I'm going to stick with making hot chocolate the old way."
1,"The Switch in Kiwi Berry is quite tasty-  it's very berry but not quite kiwi...The kiwi is very subdued, seems like it enhances the tartness of the berry but doesn't quite warrant ""kiwi"" in the flavor title....<br /><br />The Switch is a good replacement for traditional sugar/corn syrup laden sodas...It is not necessarily lower in carbs, as the sweetness comes from the juices...For me, as a diabetic, I would use these instead of coke or juice boxes when treating a hypoglycemic episode... My child does not like anything ""sparkling"" but if I had kids who liked soda, I would probably try to move them over to something like this (actually, probably to water or sparkling water with a splash of juice) for special occasions...<br /><br />The flavor is very sweet (even though it is ""natural"" from the juices) and very tasty... The carbonation is light and sparkling- the flavor and carbonation reminded me of Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Cider, but a little more fun..."
1,"The Switch bills itself as ""great tasting healthy alternative to soda"" so I decided to see for myself. The first thing I wanted to do was compare it's nutritional facts against my favorite orange soda and this is how they matched up:<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine (Per Serving)<br />16.97 Calories<br />1.8 mg Sodium<br />4.3 g Carb<br />4.1 g Sugar<br />20% RDA Vitamin A<br />100% RDA Vitamin C<br /><br />National Brand Orange Soda (Per Serving)<br />15.8 Calories<br />3.7 mg Sodium<br />4.3 g Carb<br />4.3 g Sugar<br /><br />Besides slightly less sodium, the addition of vitamins and no added sugars <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> didn't really stand out as a winner based on nutritional facts alone. So when it came to drinking it, I had expected to prefer the more natural taste that The Switch might offer.  Unfortunately the main two juices used in this drink are Apple and Grape and that left me not tasting the ""Orange Tangerine"" as much as I had wanted.<br /><br />Overall when comparing the two beverages not only did it not impress me with taste or nutrition, but add on the obvious price difference ($.03 per ounce vs. $.11 per ounce) and The Switch won't be causing me to switch. I'm happy to stick with my good old orange soda."
3,"very rich chocolate taste.not too sweet,great for a cold winter evening topped with mini marshmellows. i will certainly reccomend it"
0,"For starters, I am a coffee lover.  I have my own Behmor coffee roaster, and everything from Columbian to Ethiopian green coffee that I roast and drink regularly.  I started looking for a good afternoon/early evening tea, and prefer English Breakfast or Earl Grey.  Once I came across Rishi's Earl Grey, I was hooked.  From opening their container, you immediately get a blast of aroma that permeates full of Orange Pekoe that follows through to the cup.<br /><br />I don't want to write a long opinionated review, but I believe this is a must try for any black tea drinkers out there.  You might not be as impressed or in love with Rishi's Earl Grey as I am, but you won't say it was a waste of money or time."
1,"My impression of the Switch beverage was good overall.<br /><br />I was curious to see how good it would be.  After all, its not difficult to add some club soda to your own orange juice for an identical benefit at a lower price.<br /><br />The taste is fairly good.  It is heavy on the ""tangerine"" flavor.  Its a bit syrupy, with a high carbonation typical of many European drinks I've had.<br /><br />The juices that comprise this beverage, in order of quantity, are:<br />Apple<br />Grape<br />Tangerine<br />Orange<br />Acerola Cherry<br /><br />Needless to say, I think it would be difficult to mimic the exact flavor at home, due to the mix of the 5 juices they have.  Overall, you probably will be pleased with the drink.  Certainly, the canned beverage is more convenient than mixing your own, which is impossible if you are on the go.<br /><br />I will probably be buying more of this product, however, I did not find the flavor to be so compelling that I would recommend it heartily to a friend."
0,"I've tried a variety of Ahmad tea. Not because I particularly like this brand, but they are just easier to come across.  The Imperial blend, I believe, is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I've tried. It's full body like a good cup of Assam, which by no means overpower the delightful, clean taste of Darjeerling, complete with a long lasting note of bergamot. I enjoy it best in the evening. It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day.<br /><br />For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication."
2,My daughter loves these snacks and can't get them in China where she is working now so I ordered them for her. Very satisfied and she was very appreciative.
4,"I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. She's an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it. Clearly, mine does."
0,I have purchased some of the most expensive green tea's while in Japan.  This rival's all of them at a MUCH more affordable price.
0,"I only thought I knew what Green Tea was supposed to taste like before trying this awesome product. My local grocery store was clearing it out (much to my benefit). Once I experienced it, I drove back the very next morning and bought the remaining inventory they had to enjoy and share with friends. Several months later after running out, I went to the company's website in Aspen Colorado and ordered some more.<br /><br />When I ran out again, they were kind enough to inform me that I could order it from Amazon and that it would qualify for Amazon's awesome free shipping. What an amazing deal. Thanks to everyone at Two Leaves and a Bud and Amazon for their insight to carry such a great product.<br /><br />Bt the way... This is ""Whole Leaf Green Tea"" and the tea bags are adorable sachets versus the paper type you get with everyone else. Top drawer stuff. You actually savor every last drop."
2,"At the age of about 4 months, my little boy stopped gaining weight and dropped from the 55th percentile to the 2nd very quickly.  I am SO GLAD that I found Nurturme at the time I did.  It allowed me to start introducing him to solid foods, while mixing it with breastmilk or formula, so not only was he getting the calories from the food, but from the milk as well.  After several months on Nurturme, he is gaining weight at a steady rate and we no longer have to be concerned about his growth.<br />I also have a SUPER picky 3 year old who won't touch a vegetable if I cover it in chocolate and call it a Twinkie.  I am able to add a packet or two of the Nurturme veggies to her mac & cheese or other foods to sneak her in some nutrition.  Now to try that on my husband..."
0,THIS IS FOR MY SUNTS FOR CHRISTMAS THEY LOVE THIS KIND OF TEA AND NOW THAT IT IS K-CUPS THEY ARE EVEN HAPPIER.
1,"If you like the sort of carbonated fruit punch that you get at, e.g., office holiday parties (where alcohol is verboten), you'll probably like The Switch: It does have a nice, ""fruity"" taste (kind of a ""sharp"" orange -- perhaps the tangerine's influence, although probably more the apple juice), with a bit of a bite due to the carbonation.  If this were one of my options at, e.g., the Medusa-esque soda dispensers found at 7-11, I would definitely indulge occasionally and buy some.<br /><br />But an indulgence it is... and that's why I'm not planning on purchasing more from Amazon.  In particular:<br /><br />-- You're paying nearly a buck a can for a little more than a cup of soda.  Please.  I don't mind paying more for higher-quality goods, but at least make it a decent value for the money... make it 12oz.<br />-- Calorically it's not a great value, having around half-again as many calories per once as Coca Cola does.  If you're some teen who can eat whatever you want, this doesn't matter... but for those of us who aren't blessed with such metabolisms... well... the calories are better ""spent"" elsewhere.  The ""no sugar added!"" bit is somewhere between annoying and downright misleading: The ""all natural"" sugar that's coming from the fruit juices is no better nor worse for you than, e.g., regular old cane sugar like better traditional soft drinks have.<br /><br />So, in brief, yes, it is quite tasty, but it's really not a good deal for your pocketbook nor your health unless consumed only on special occasions.<br /><br />P.S. -- My wife tried some as well, and didn't like it as much; she tasted some of the unpleasant ""metallic"" tastes that others here have mentioned."
4,"Don't know why people want to step in cold cat vomit on their to the bathroom in the middle of night, but this will get the job done. Vomit stains carpets, beds, shirts. You will find hard, old fossilized vomit under beds occasionally too.  Entire rooms of carpet will need replacing.<br /><br />If you have all wood floors and love cat vomit, go for it.<br /><br />However, it is a beautiful decorative grass when potted on it's own or mixed with herbs. Just keep out of cat's reach. Good air freshener if you grow enough indoors.<br /><br />No idea why people want cat vomit indoors though.<br /><br />3 stars because it is wheat grass which can be bought in bulk much cheaper for couple bucks more."
1,"sweet, juicy and yummy. I have to try hard not to eat too much at one time. So addictive. It tastes just like those in Asian market. Actually this one tastes a bit better."
4,"This product has better grade materials used to create it than other ""general feed"" brands such as Fri$kies, Me0w M!x, Pur1na, etc because they are essentially just a bunch of fillers, this has at least some chicken meal as the main ingredient setting it far above them in quality. At a price of 30 for 40LB its less than a dollar pound, and the cheapest food prices i have seen are around 60 - 75 cents per lb so its a great price considering its quality. You can use this as a filler mixed in with better brands if your cats dont get snobby and refuse to eat the cheaper stuff when better food is in the bowl with it. Diamond makes another version, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OH73FO"">Diamond Naturals Dry Food for Adult Cats, Active Cat Chicken and Rice Formula, 18 Pound Bag</a>  which is a premium type and much healthier. This mixes well 60/40 with it so i dont spend a fortune and they get very healthy meals. My cats like this just as much as the premium. I have a public wish list of other brands of healthy premium food here on amazon at good prices (around 1.50 - 2.00 lb)if anyone is interested. Hope this helps all your kitties!"
0,This is good iced tea. It is hard to find locally in the Fall and Winter.
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry soda is an all natural soda. It's a little sweet for my taste. If you want to give yourself or your kids a soda treat, I'd certainly buy Switch instead of regular soda that is loaded with sugar and chemicals. Worth a try."
2,"Organic foods are probably most important the first couple of years of life. That is when so much brain development is happening that trying to keep as much pesticides as possible away from your child's developing brain and body is a very worthy goal.<br /><br />Fortunately it is a little easier than it is for a grown up. With our more varied foods and time constraints and on the go, etc. Also no matter how worthy a goal, your child has to eat the food. This is an excellent combination of flavors that I was not always able to find at local stores. And with subscribe and save it is cheaper and delivered to my door.<br /><br />The flavors are vegetable turkey which lists the ingredients as Water, organic carrots, organic apples, organic ground turkey, organic whole barley flour.<br /><br />Sweet potato and chicken: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.<br /><br />Summer vegetable: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.<br /><br />Rice and Lentil: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil<br /><br />There are other Earth Best blends where water is not the number one ingredient. Obviously that somewhat calls into the question the 'value' of this particular Earth's best item. I just found the tomato and carrot one which I have ordered but not received yet.  Also if you put in organic baby food in Amazon search there are some brands with just food in them for example Peter Rabbit organics (have not yet tried it, but might when she is a bit older).<br /><br />Overall though I do recommend this variety pack. Our daughter likes them all and she is getting organic ingredients. And for a decent price, even considering the amount of water in them. The water being first in all 4 is giving me pause as to the overall value and definitely something I will keep in mind as to trying other brands going forward. The ingredient lists are all directly from the Earth Best's website, earthsbest.com,  as I do not have the products in front of my right now."
4,"My cats aren't usually picky and I've had them on Natural Balance Venison grain free canned and dry food but one still has digestive problems (probably from ten years of eating ""junk"" kitty food) so I keep trying to find a food that will help to heal him. I tried Felidae and he and one other cat eats it, but the other two don't. I do believe one is extremely picky because he won't eat Halo brand either but loves the Natural Balance and Taste of the Wild grain free options. I hate having to buy so many different brands to please my four cats! Also - this says 95% protein derived from fish - so maybe they are having a distaste for the fish? It's too bad because they do love tuna but it causes the sick one to vomit every time. Oh well, it's a another miss in our family."
2,"Fish has that all important DHA that helps brain and eye development so I went looking for a baby food with fish. I was so excited to find WILD CAUGHT salmon in a baby food (wild caught salmon does not have the mercury content other fish have)! Plus it has other super foods such as lentils, sweet potatoes, and carrots! But all this goodness is only good if baby will eat it and she gobbled it right up!!"
3,"this is our 2nd. k-cup brewer and this one is awesome! coffee or tea-cup size choice,hot cocoa and on and on.very easy to use.makes a great cup every time with very little effort! what more could you want?very pleased as usual w/keurig products.extremely durable and reliable and fast.buy this brewer and you wont need another for many years to come!"
3,"When I weigh the convenience of a K cup against the price and the taste, I would characterize these as a winner. Not the best cup of cocoa on the planet but compared to making it yourself or using a packet, these are pretty darn good. They nice a nice chocolate flavor with no funny after taste that I've had with some other brands. Do not select 10 oz on your machine though. Make it only at 6 or 8 oz otherwise it will be watery in my opinion. All in all a fine cup of hot chocolate."
3,"We have tried many of the different hot cocoa k-cups...everything always tasted so watered down, even when using the smallest setting on the machine.  However, this brand...even at the medium cup setting, tasted fantastic.  I highly recommend Grove Square.  I haven't tried any of their other products, but I would be inclined to now based on this cocoa."
0,"Valerian and Chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves, lemon grass, hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. This tea is much more effective than regular Sleepytime and I can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. You may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. This could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. Valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, you won't feel groggy the next morning. Blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
1,"What is supposed to be the purpose of this soda? ""100% juice""--but not 100% of what's on the front of the label. Kiwi, raspberry, and strawberry juice concentrates are lesser ingredients; apple and grape juice are in the majority. And so what if it has 100% of the RDA of Vitamin C. So do a lot of other things. Is it possible to OD on vitamin C?<br /><br />The bottom line, though, is no matter what the combination of juices is, it tastes like cheap candy. Not pleasant at all."
4,"I was at my wits end with hypoallergenic foods for my cat with IBD. This one is one he will finally eat, and even ask for. Nothing is more heartrending than trying to get a sick cat to eat, and putting expensive prescription food down to have him sniff, walk away, and cry for food.. I was so relieved when I found this. My cat is now maintaining.. I pray they continue to make it for years to come!"
2,"I was hoping that the new recipe would include more protein/fat than the original, since in my opinion, the protein/essential fatty acids that are abundant in salmon are the best reasons to feed it to a baby.  Well, I should have taken the time to research the nutritional info before purchasing, because this item actually contains less of both. If you can manage to get your baby to eat an entire pouch of this, he/she will get a mere 1 gram of protein, or 6% of the RDA for a baby, .5 grams of fat, and 50 calories.<br /><br />That makes this a nutrient poor food.  And HappyBaby a pretty despicable company."
4,"My cat is 12 years old and very finicky about what she eats...she has never eaten dry food..she will starve before touching dry food. But..mostly she just meows as loud as she can and gets into mischief if she doesn't have what she wants to eat.... She loves this type of cat food, though. I don't know whether it is the cheese she likes, or the over all taste...but she devours it every time....I wish it was smooth instead of strips, as she seems to have trouble chewing it...I wish the grocery stores would stock more of it, as i usually buy for a month at a time..."
2,"Mama Grain and Amaranth Ratatouille from Happy Baby have been long-time favorites since my son was about 10 months old. Even now he is a toddler, he still eats Mama Grain on occasion - it's good to take with us if we're eating out and he's being picky about what's available. It's thick and filling enough to supplement his meal. It has a sweetness from the bananas, obviously, but the black beans and the quinoa grain also help making it more lasting. So full of goodness! I agree the taste seems a little weird at first to us adults, but I actually like that's a different flavor - help to keep his taste buds open to different tastes, hopefully..."
1,"Dare I be corny and say, ""Make a switch to The Switch?""  This soda has a great orange-tangerine taste.  It is juice with carbonation, therefore, it can tout that it is all natural, without any added sugars.  It lacks that sickly sweet taste that soda with high fructose corn syrup tends to have, which is a bonus.<br /><br />This can at 8.3 oz is following the `skinny can' trend, as well, which I think is great for packing in a cooler, your bag, or a picnic basket.  I would put these out at a party, as well, for mixed drinks, self service, and sake of ease."
0,"Price was misleading, once the high shipping rate was added, the tea was no longer the 'deal' it was promoted to be. Although once it finally arrived, it was half decent tea, but NOT worth the shipping and the wait, will go to my local tea house next time."
1,"The Switch is a 100% juice carbonated beverage in an 8oz can. So, it's not really a soda because its not in a 12oz can. It's not an energy drink, which is what you usually see in these small cans. It's all fruit juice which means it is all natural and better for you than those so called fruit drinks with tons of sugar and preservatives. It tastes good, but not great, and the carbonation definitely gives it a kick. At about a dollar a can, I don't know if its worth the price for me to buy any more, but it does taste good. Perhaps pick some up in a smaller size before buying 24 cans. My kids liked the taste at first, but soon tired of the carbonation."
1,"The advert for Switch describes it as a ""healthy alternative to soda"" and ""a perfect balance beween juice and carbonation."" To get right to it, let us tackle the first claim. The can of Switch I got (Orange Tangerine) was 8.3 fluid ounces. Those 8.3 ounces contain 36g carbs, 34g sugars and 15g sodium and packs 140 calories. To put this in perspective, the 20 fluid ounce bottle of vanilla Coke sitting on my desk right now  contains 28g carbs, 28g sugars and 25mg sodium, and has 100 calories. In other words, a bottle of conventional soda 2.5x as large has less calories, less carbs, and less sugars. Granted, Switch has less sodium, but if we poured equivalent amounts of drink, i.e. 20 oz vs. 20 oz, it would have much more. The drawing power of Switch, then, is that it boasts 100% RDA of Vitamin C and 20% RDA of Vitamin A vs 0% in these categories for Coke, and that it has plenty of carbonation to satisfy the taste of soda-lovers. In my mind this doesn't quite balance the scale<br /><br />As to the second claim: I liked the balance between a fruit juice and a carbonated drink. It reminded me of Orangina in that it is sharp and crisp and has a bite to it, but it might strike some as too sugary-sweet. All in all I think this is likely to be one of those drinks that people like very much or no at all, no in-betweens. However, it can be considered ""healty"" only in small doses (one can day, say) and should be avoided by low-carb dieters."
2,"I am loving Earth's Best brand overall.  I set out with the goal of making all of our son's food.  However, when I returned to work full time the puree time was less.  So my go-to backup is Earth's Best Baby Food.  We're on stage two now, almost stage 3, and he loves them.  I appreciate the no added sugars / preservatives and that it's mostly organic.  He loves the taste and combos.  Good stuff, great product, LOVE IT!"
3,"Just got a new keurig and immediately went on a search for<br />the best dark rich bold coffee (Caribou Mahogany) and other brands<br />with rich taste (Wolfgang is winning so far) but really wanted to find<br />the best hot cocoas and got these first...now trying to give them away.<br />The are even worse than the packaged kind you get in the stores. Actually,<br />I think I've found better instant ones. I hate to write a bad review but..if<br />you want to find a DELICIOUS cocoa mix in the K-cups...get the Grove (Station) brand<br />here on Amazon.  They are always sold out (which DUH I know why now as they are a far better<br />tasting brand) but if<br />you put your email on a wait list, they'll let you know when they come in and<br />you dont have to wait very long.  I'd stock up though, as you'll find you want a cup<br />or two every night! (and the dark, milk and peppermint combined box is the bomb!!)I just<br />sent a couple boxes out to a friend of mine who was complaining about how bad the k cup hot<br />chocolates were....she'll be thrilled to get my care package!!"
1,"I sampled a can of Switch Orange Tangerine and found it to be a tasty beverage. As advertised, it is a ""...balance between juice and carbonated"" with a light carbonation so it doesn't taste like Orange Crush or Fanta but not like orange Gatorade either. The 8.3 oz can has 140 calories, with a 12% DV carb/sugar content but 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vit A. It's marketed as ""100% juice"" coming mostly from filtered concentrates. No sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, if you're concerned with all that. Most important is that it tastes good and I would try it again."
1,"My review is of the Strawberry-Melon flavor only. I did not try the other flavors in the variety pack as I puchased mine individually.<br /><br />I don't usually drink these types of beverages, nor do I drink much soda. I generally dislike overly sweet, artificial ingredient laden stuff. Quite by chance I tried a Strawberry Melon FUZE slenderize beverage and really liked it.<br /><br />What I liked most was the pleasing flavor and the absence of sugar, although it does have sucralose as a sweetener (rather than aspartame). It was not overly sweetened and the blend of strawberry and melon flavor was for me perfectly balanced; I could clearly distinguish both flavors.  FUZE was really tasty, no strong aftertaste and no sugar ""heaviness"" in the mouth. It was honestly the first time I've had this type of beverage other than a Snapple Tea beverage that I would purchase again.<br /><br />I'm a little skeptical of the benefits of the micro-nutrients that are added to this beverage; L-Carnitine, Super Citrimax and Chromium. Perhaps it's a bit more marketing hype rather than beneficial. Nonetheless, I found this beverage to be refreshing, tasty and something I would buy again.<br /><br />It is a little bit pricey though. Compared to a 12-pack of store brand Diet Soda, which in my neck of the woods ia around $2.99 or a little over $.02/ounce, FUZE beverage is priced $24.99 for 15-18.5 ounce bottles, or a little over $.09/ounce. That makes it more than 4 times as expensive as the store brand diet sodas.<br /><br />In spite of the price, I would buy this again and would justify the price by considering this more of a treat rather than a water substitute.<br /><br />5 stars."
3,"The best hot chocolate,by far.. Not so easily available in my area.<br />Love the mocha & the double chocolate"
2,"I bought this because it's organic cheese puff. My son love Gerber cheese Lil' Crunchies. I thought he may like this too. I subscribe it once a month. Now there is 4 cans not open. The idea of mixing cheese and carrot is great, but there is no taste for this cheese snack. There is no cheese flavor in the puff. My son opened the can and keeps giving the puff to me. My son love Happybaby's yogurt melts, beef stew, happy baby banana beet blueberry and Spinach, Mango and Pear. This cheese puff does not work for him."
0,"This is a very smooth tea from Argo Tea.  I was so excited when they came to NYC, and I bought a bag of this tea to make at home.  It has an almondy/chocolatey flavor (but not overpowering).  It's a great tea for everyone, including people just starting to drink tea.  I love it in a Latte (I just microwave some milk and use that instead of water)."
1,"I tried this product after Switch's Watermelon-Strawberry drink, and while I thought that drink was decent, I was not a big fan of the Orange-Tangerine flavor.  The taste was an obvious blend of a number of different flavors in addition to orange and tangerine, and for me that made it taste more Orange-ish than Orange.  As others have noted, the amount of calories and sugar are not that different from a cola, so it's not really clear that it's THAT much healthier than other sodas.<br /><br />Personally though, I'd rather just grab a glass of orange juice or eat an orange instead.  I guess it depends on what you are deciding to ""switch"" from: for people looking for an alternative to cola, I guess this might be an attractive product.  But as someone who prefers water or tea and rarely drinks sodas, this product isn't close to making me want to ""switch""."
0,"I fisrt bought Twinings Lady Earl Grey tea in Kirkwall, Orkney, Scotland. It was for a friend, but I got a box for myself. WOW. This sampler has some of the best varieties,including the Lady Earl Grey.You may also want to get the 4 Fruits. 40% off and free shipping, does life get better?"
3,"I like  Stephen`s  Gourmet Hot  Cocoa , White  Chocolate  Mix ,because to me  it taste like  Arabian  White  Chocolate ,the taste is  almost identical ,if it had a little  Arabian vanilla  it would  be a copy cat. This  cocoa  to me  has  alot of  class ,unlike the others this  Stephens white chocolate  mix has alot of  class .I just  have to  say  Thankyou  Stephen ,I really enjoy sipping white hot  cocoa  again.  A friend told  me how  delicious  this  cocoa  was ,I never imagined  how  delicious . I am  so  glad  I purchased  it,  THANKYOU STEPHEN , A customer  for  life !  Terry Merrill"
1,"I was a little disappointed with this soda.  True, it's all natural and only fruit juice sweetened, but it's too sweet for my taste.  I diluted it with cold water, and enjoyed it.  I don't drink fruit ""drinks"" that are not 100% juice, so I thought this would be good.  I prefer the fresh, clean taste of the Knudsen spritzers.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a more natural fruit soda, this might be what you're looking for.  If you want a refreshing juice with some fizz, try the Knudsen spritzers."
0,"Yogi Teas are the highest quality--organic, earth-friendly, and flavorful. I prefer them to any other brand. The calming tea is slightly spicy and relaxing; the packaging is good for the environment. I love reading the exercises and philosophical messages on the box. Yogi Tea is the bomb!"
0,"The flavor is different,and a little 'earthy' for us, but we brew it together with another tea which works well.  This is a good value."
3,I recently bought a Keurig coffee maker and was looking for k-cups when I discovered this.  My daughter is a hot chocolate lover and so I decided to give this a try.  If your coffee machine has different size drink settings use smallest size setting otherwise it is too watery but when done on the lowest size setting it makes a very good cup of hot cocoa.  My daughter loves it and has it nearly every morning.  It is very convenient and if you have a Keurig coffee maker and are looking for drink alternatives to coffee this is a good choice.
0,I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.
3,"I went to a gourmet store and asked for their ""Chocolate Expert"" to recommend a chocolate among the high-end makers.  He pointed out this brand, which was affordable as well as incredibly flavorful.  If you need a chocolate to melt in your mouth, savor the Santander 53% cocoa."
4,"I have 2 ""picky-eater"" cats. They aren't really fans of canned food, particularly my male cat, but they are on canned food through a recommendation from my vet. Picky as they are, both cats will actually eat this and appear to enjoy it. I have this on automatic shipping and it is so convenient not to have to go to the store and deal with the possibility of the store being out of stock or not having enough for me to stock up. This is a pate food. The smell isn't horrible either, which I am sensitive to when it comes to canned pet food. All around great product!"
3,"So if you are a person who likes swiss miss / hot cocoa packets or hot cocoa from a gas station SO DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!  I can not taste any chocolate flavor in it whatsoever.  It just tastes like heated sugar water and nasty sugar water at that.  This product has a strong fake sugar taste and I am perfectly OK with diet sodas and other fake sugar products.  There is something about this I just can not put a finger on it but it made my stomach curl.  I even waited for it to cool down, but it got worse.  Very disapointed in this product and it was not what I was expecting at all."
1,"Switch has ""100% of what you want"" and ""0% of what you don't,""  according to the can.  Also, according to the can it is ""100% juice.""  According to the Amazon product page it contains soy.  Quoting the printed page:  ""Ingredients: 100% Juice (Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange and Acerola Juice Concentrates), Gum Acacia, Natural Flavors and Colors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). Contains Soy.""<br /><br />There is an unusual taste.  It is difficult to decide whether it is the taste of the can or the taste of the soy.<br /><br />The price is surprising. The calories are shocking. One can has 140 calories.<br /><br />Who knows?  We may develop a taste for Switch."
4,My cats loved the treats but everytime I try to use the bags zipper to close it up I gotta fiddle with it for a while just to close the bag. Eventually The bag didn't close properly and all the treats dried out causing the cats to lose interest. I plan to buy another but this time I will dump it in my own container.
2,"My son has been eating these for the last two years and loves them.  I love them because they have yogurt in them, and for a picky eater provides some good nutrition.  Wish they were organic, but we can't have them all.  Much healthier than Nutragrain."
0,Fabulous gift.  The blooming teas were lovely and unique.  Packaging was beautiful and perfect for a gift.
0,"I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA"">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />I'm glad I ordered this when I did, the price has more than doubled! I'd still say it's a GREAT value. This is my go to tea when I want something with a little more flavor than ""regular"" black tea. I don't sweeten my tea, but I think this would be a perfect sweet tea for a hot day. The orange flavor is very palatable unlike some others. It's noticeable without being pungent or artificial. It also isn't spiced like many other orange teas."
0,"I have to admit I love this tea, I put splenda in it and the taste is so wonderful. I have probably went through 7 6pack boxes this year alone, not counting the other teas i drink. This is a must try hot or cold.."
1,"I really enjoyed the taste of this product. It neither seemed too ""berry"" or too ""kiwi"" -- it was a nice balance. I would compare this to a strongly-flavored carbonated water product. The flavor is clean and crisp, and not overpowering.<br /><br />The product provides 100% of vitamin C -- a definite plus. However, the product has 34g of carbs, 33g of which are sugars. Granted, these are not processed sugars and are only natural sugars from the fruit juices the product contains. However, this results in a product that has 135 calories in an 8.3-ounce can. This results in a poor substitute for soda.<br /><br />It's an all-natural product, and tastes great, but has entirely too many calories for such a small serving."
4,"I am not sure if my cat loves Halo, but whenever I try to change brands, my cat looks happier going back to Halo. Like other reviewers, the poop seems to be least smelly. Also, one noticeable difference when I feed Halo is that my cat seems to eat in a controlled manner- eats throughout the day. I guess that is a good thing? When I feed other brands, my cat eats it uncontrollably all at once."
1,"While taste is OK it's simply using too many artificial colors (blue1, red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6 - approved by FDA doesn't mean it's healthy) and other chemicals (BHT etc) to be used by children.<br />If you're going to eat it yourself - take your chances. But since there are many good and healthy alternatives - why bother?"
4,My cats really love this 9 Lives Seafood and Poultry cat food.<br />They prefer this pate to the slices or chunks.<br />They are a perfect weight and have beautiful shiny coats<br />and lots of energy.<br />It is good quality food and is very fresh.
2,"This is a new treat for our ""kids"". They are pretty picky eaters, especially my girl! They both love 'em. Glad I found this product. Reasonably priced too"
0,"I had some at PF Changs and raved about it so my daughter who is a gifted giver picked up on it and gave me some along with a cast iron tea set for my birthday. I keep a box at work and brew it in a cup and it tastes just fine, but it really does taste better when brewed in a cast iron teapot and sipped from a small cast iron cup. The teapot and cups are enameled on the inside so it must be a temperature thing because the tea never touches the iron. I have tried it with honey but usually just drink it plain.<br />There are other ingredients besides green tea, mostly natural, plus ""pineapple flavor"" whatever that is. Good-tasting green tea is rare, so I ordered half a dozen boxes myself and enjoy it whenever I get a chance."
1,"This drink was sickeningly sweet (and I am a Mountain Dew addict, so I usually have no problem with sweet).  It was much like drinking snow cone flavoring straight from the bottle.  While it is all natural with no added sugar, it still has 140 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  A 16 oz can of Mountain Dew has 170 calories.  Definitely not a ""diet"" drink.  The only way I would recommend it is to keep away from high fructose corn syrup, but even then, at the price, it almost too expensive of an option."
1,"If you like Orange Crush you may become a fan, but it's too much of a hybrid for me. The main two ingredients are reconstituted apple and grape juices. It contains something called Acerola juice, which is high in Vitamin C (and indeed the can contains 100% of your C and 20% of your A).<br /><br />The sugar content is high---34 grams---which brings the carb percentage up to 12% for the day and the calorie count to 140. I think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to ""spend"" them on Switch, which almost tastes like carbonated TANG.  I've tried the Ooba drinks, and they are much lighter and more refreshing. Guess I'm just not ready to make the Switch!"
1,"I really enjoy trying new things, so I found the idea of this soda pleasing.  It is essentially carbonated fruit juice, so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink.  I think this might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be.  However, I think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this ""natural"" drink tastes a bit artificial.  This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always effects the flavor.  However, unlike the watermelon flavor, I found this variety vibrant and delicious.  The fruit flavor really comes through, including the often tricky tangerine.  It is an expensive treat, but would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice."
1,First of all I happen to think this is delicious. It has no diet after taste as with most artificially sweetened sodas. Anyway the people who downward this are missing the point that this is NOT using poison to sweeten it. Stevia is natural. I have extremely sensitive taste buds and a sophisticated pallet and I can tell you that there's not much of a difference in flavor between say Sucralose(which is awful for you) and Stevia which is 100% safe.<br />So if u want to trash this and keep feeding you and your kids garbage and poison by all means. Google what artificial sweeteners do to the immune system. I used to be good for three colds per year and two sinus infections per year. Since eliminating all artificial sweeteners(from drinks gums candies etc they sneak it in everything now. Start reading labels) I have not been sick ONCE in 4 Yeats since eliminating it. So I'll stick to Blue sky when I choose to have a soda. It's delicious.
4,"I have discovered the Wellness brand of cat food, and I (and my cat) adore it. I only wish it were easier to afford! Still, Amazon seems to either match PetSmart or have a better deal. (These treats, they only matched the price, but I like Amazon)<br /><br />When I open the bedside drawer that these are stored in, Ariel comes running! She would tear the bag open and eat them all if I were to accidentally leave it out! She LOVES these treats.<br /><br />I am glad that I can spoil my cat with healthy treats/food like the Wellness brand. I highly recommend these treats, although as long as they remain 4.99 you might want to first purchase from a local pet store to make sure your cat likes them."
3,"This is by far the best K-cup hot cocoa we have tried.  It has a nice rich flavor and with the added convenience of a K-cup, it is easy to have a cup anytime you like. Highly recommend!"
2,"I would love to say that I have the time to make my son's food everyday. Its not the case. Honestly, I do make it most of the time, but some days, you just don't have the time/energy to get it all done. Enter this product. Before I bought this baby food, I read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it, its like a dessert, yadda yadda yadda. The truth is, is that yes, it has a bit of fruit in it, but its not sweet at all. The fruit merely brings out the flavors naturally so that you don't have to add anything else. Its a great product to enter proteins into baby's diet. The consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also, baby will not choke on it. I highly recommend."
0,"so anyways, i wished that i could find ginseng tea more easier, but for the price excluding the shipping i suppose its allright. comes in a weird form, not powder kinda like small bits of grass. Taste fine not sour or sweet"
2,3 of the flavors are pretty good but the Sweet Potato & Chicken is pretty gross. I was wondering why my daughter didn't want to eat it until I tried it myself
2,"OK so I bought the Sam's Club Fruit Snacks thinking I could save some money.  Come on they are 5 and 2 they'll eat anything with sugar, right?  WRONG.  They LOVE the Scooby-Doo fruit snacks.  Now I just have to find poor kids that can eat the Sam's Club Fruit Snacks."
1,"I typicaly drink Mountain Dew or more recently the Picth Black but this is my favorite soda! Beaware they have tried to change the logo and add the words ""Fruit Punch"" ... as if we don't know. It's just a bad logo change and someone should be fired for it. Unfortunatly I have yet to find a substitute for the times when I can't find it so get it while you can!"
1,If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.
4,"My Bengal kitten loves this stuff. His fur feels like mink/cashmere, and he has a very healthy diet with this brand wet food."
2,"I love, love, love the idea of this product and my little one loves, loves, loves to use it.  She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I don't have to worry about her choking.  The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.  Granted, some foods are more difficult than others and some don't cause that much of a problem.  Bananas however, have pretty much destroyed a couple of them.  While I love this product, I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags."
0,"I had high hopes for this tea, but I have to agree with the reviewers who called it bland. I normally drink Twinings Ceylon OP, English Breakfast, or PG Tips, and those are all much more flavorful. Even using twice the tea I don't get as strong or dark a cup with three minutes of steeping. The tea itself looks fine and seems appropriately packaged. Davidson's seems like a great company (check out their website) and has lots of organic and Fair Trade teas, so I'll give them another shot with a different variety."
3,"OK - this is not the finest European chocolate.  BUT, you can make it in your Keurig and all 3 flavors taste good.  I've joined the ""club"" and get the lowest possible cost.  No charge to join and no effort to quit.  Why not?  It's nice to have when you're dieting, because it's just enough chocolate to keep you on track.  Non-dieters will like it for the convenience."
4,"First, I have to say my cat loves the Fussie Cat foods. She has a malabsorption problem and switching to Fussie Cat has really helped with the throwing up and loose stools. We've tried almost every variety and am impressed with the quality; hence the 4-star rating. Being able to get this brand with subscribe and save rocks and it saves me a lot of money.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the Tuna with Shrimp case just came and was full of dented, slightly damaged cans. None of the cans have broken open or been punctured, but the dents aren't minor and since these are sold as 'new' I shouldn't be receiving dented cans. Hopefully this is just a one off occurrence."
0,This tea is a wonderfully tasting tea.  It has a great aroma and lifts the spirits!  The price was good as well.
2,"My 22-month old daughter has loved these ever since she started chewing her food.  They are tasty, healthy, and have zero additives.  On the downside, every few handfuls there is a pea that is as hard as a freaking ROCK.  I can barely crunch into it with my adult teeth, so I worry about what would happen if she really bites down on them with her baby teeth.  That being said, it's been months and nothing bad has happened...and it hasn't worried me enough to stop feeding her the peas, it's just something that I feel should be noted to those considering purchasing this otherwise excellent product."
1,"This carbonated fruit drink reminds me a little of Mountain Dew Code Red, except this is 100% fruit juice (apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry) reconstituted from concentrate with sparkling water.  It has 33 grams of sugar in an 8.3 ounce can, but at least it's natural sugar from the fruit rather than corn syrup.<br /><br />It has a rather strong sweet/sour taste, I would think you need to like fruity sour flavors to like this drink.  I think they could reduce the fruit juice content about 1/3 and it would still be very tasty and have less sugar.<br /><br />Still for me this would rate 5 stars except for the price, at almost $1 per can unfortunately I don't think I would buy it very often."
0,"I had just tried the Yogi Rejuvenation which is good.  But this one contains 0 actual tea leaves.  It has that artificial sweenter taste and i found myself wincing after each sip like it was medicine.  Not very enjoyable.  Really bad tasting as well.  Also, returns are not elgible for this item.  I would rather have a stuffy nose than put myself through a cup of this bad, bad tasting concoction of herbs."
1,"I've tried a few different flavors of Switch and this is my least favorite. (My favorite is the cherry.) Unfortunately because I didn't enjoy this flavor I didn't find it as refreshing as the others.<br /><br />I quickly handed it over to my son who does like kiwi berry flavors and he did like it a lot. Of course, since it contains enough vitamin C for a whole day, I felt just fine giving it to my child, too. No preservatives, no added sugar. I like the carbonated soda product a lot, just not this flavor.<br /><br />However, the biggest flaw with this product is that it's too expensive in my opinion for the little cans you get. Rounds out to about $1 per can. Less than you pay often with a vending machine but twice what you pay for a flavored water or vitamin C juice pouch when you buy them in larger quantity. Not worth it. :("
2,This was a good buy. The variety is still close enough so i didn't have to worry if baby will like the next one
1,i don't know why one reviewer said the orange flavor was overpowering.  i find it has an excellent taste and nice orange aroma.  love the tea and have been drinking it several times a day.  i'm buying more.
1,"Izze Sparkling Grapefruit Soda is absolutely delicious, even though it is not 100% flavored with grapefruit juice. It's amazing that such a strong, mellow grapefruit taste can come from a mixture of fruit juices. However, the totaly effect is explosively great -- not too tart, not too sweet and wonderfully refreshing.<br /><br />It's perfect on its own own or with a snack because it's not overpowering, it's just the right touch to add to your meals. If you're tired of drinking beverages with ingredients that you can't pronounce, Izze Sparkling Grapefruit Soda is the drink for you.<br /><br />It's a healthy alternative to chemical-laden sodas!"
0,I have no idea what all these reviews for this brand of dieters tea are talking about. I followed the directions nothing happened. Brewed a stronger cup-still nothing.Even measured out the water to 6oz and let the tea bag seep for five minutes-nothing just stronger tasting tea. On the box it tells you not to drink more than 1 cup in a 24 hour period- I drank three the other day not even thinking about it and nothing happened! Just tasted like cranberry tea and nothing else. Strange.
1,"The Switch is apparently supposed to be a substitute for soda, with fizz but without corn syrup or added sugar, just juice.  However, the product, billed as ""Kiwi Berry"", has 135 calories in 8 ounces--more than one would get in soda--and is in fact mostly highly caloric apple and grape juice, for the sweetness, with kiwi and berries later in the ingredient list.  Yes, it is tasty, but a more healthy alternative would be club soda (or water, if you can do without the carbonation) with some juice added."
1,"IZZE is fantastic. I tried it three days ago, and haven't been anywhere without a can or bottle of it since. It could quite possibly be the world's most perfect beverage. Nothing artificial, ingredients that you can pronounce, and a taste you just cannot beat. Slightly tart and slightly sweet, this light, bubbly drink should be experienced by everyone at least once."
0,"Rishi is a wonderful tea company.  They are one of the best of the best.  Earl Grey is no exception when it comes to their line.  It starts by being double sealed to retain freshness and aroma and doesn't stop there.  It is a premium black tea with just the right mix of bergamot for a crisp, citrus note.  I have had Earl Grey's that overuse the bergamot to hide a less than sterling low note of underpar black tea to try and carry the flavor.  RISHI does it right.  You can have a taste and aroma experience, perfectly balanced to deliver maximum satisfaction.  I normally like a little raw sugar or honey in my tea, but this beautiful blend can stand on its own.  Nothing needed here but boiling water and a short wait to enjoy an excellent tea experience.  Well done RISHI!"
1,"I was actually very surprised when I took my first swig. I didn't pay attention to the ingredients, so I was expecting your typical, dull 10% fruit juice taste. To my surprise--a good thing--I was very pleased.<br />One can really taste the fruitiness of this 100% fruit beverage, and I've tasted many in my day.<br />The carbonation isn't too forcefull, either, allowing you to drink Switch very smoothly. Finally, a great alternative to your energy drinks that claim to have a fruit flavor. Say goodbye to man-made energy, and say hello to nature's source of pure health and revival."
0,Tea should be stored in an airtight container. This paper bag is just folded at the top w/o any seal. Tea was tasteless. I should have returned it but I was too lazy to do so. I am sure Amazon would have taken it back and would have paid for shipping. I like Amazon but not all the products are excellent.
0,"Out of curiosity, I chose to purchase this particular flavor of Two Leaves and a Bud at my local grocer.  I do not like the taste of the tea without sweetner -- it is very bitter even when using a lower temp for the water (because its green tea) and this is the first time I've ever tasted a green tea that I didn't care for -- The Two Leaves and a Bud Jasmine Green is divine!  With sweetener, the Orange Sencha Green is tolerable (for me).  What I like about this green tea is its medicinal effects.  On the back of all Two Leaves & A Bud packages are brief statements listing what types of foods the teas pair with and/or what the tea is ""best for.""  The Orange Sencha Green Tea states that it is best for concentration ... and it is.  If I'm feeling particulary foggy headed or out of sorts (lol), I drink a mug of Orange Sencha Green and it clears my head right up!  I appreciate teas that have effective medicinal qualities that are evident within a few sips and this makes up for the unpleasant (my opinion) taste.  I will continue to purchase it and would recommend it as a good reading or studying tea."
0,"If you havn't tried Lady Grey, try it and then buy the loose leaf at this price.  You won't regret it.  This is one of the best everyday teas I've found, with a healthy dash of citrus and a flowery finish with no cloying flavors, it really is a good all around tea for any time of the day.  Buying it on Amazon saves a lot of time trying to find it in stock and it arrived faster than the books I ordered at the same time."
2,"My son is 7 months old and this has always been his favorite baby food - it is nice a thick, which he loves!"
0,"Love this tea, its like drinking liquid red hots.  I hate herbal teas b/c they all taste and smell like potpourri but this stuff is awesome !!!!"
1,"This is a nice, refreshing carbonated drink. It has no added sugar, as advertised. But its name is a bit misleading. The ""Orange Tangerine"" also has some apple and grape juice added. The grape is not a great addition to the blend, so I wasn't thrilled with the flavor."
4,"Bottom line, this made my cat projectile vomit. I've never had a problem with him eating Friskies before but, I knew ""Cheezy Craze"" just didn't sound right. It came as a sample in one of the larger bags. Not fun to clean up after partial digestion."
1,"After the JP Morgan Corporate Challenge road race in Boston, they were handing these out at the finish line.  Not only was I able to try the tangerine which I got from Amazon I was also able to try a few of the flavors.  They were all really delicious.  They weren't heavy like a lot of sodas and you could taste the real fruit ingredients instead of the usual artificial flavorings.  The tangerine was especially good.  It was crisp, tart and refreshing and actually made for a nice recovery drink after the race to get some carbs back into the system.  My only complaint is that 8.3oz left me wanting more like a 12oz can.  Very good."
0,"High quality coca products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />Organic coca tea bags do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All coca tea  Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods.  An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store coca tea  products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea."
2,"My 15 month old has been on this for 3 months and loves it.<br />It is easy to make,(you do have to shake it a bit when you make it).<br />we add probiotics to it, for a little extra immune boosting and it<br />works great as a substitute for milk.<br />our naturalpathic doc tells us this is easier on the toddlers digestive<br />system and may even aid in less ear infections.<br />so far so good!<br />amazon has the best deal we could find also!"
0,"This tea is very good, not quit as good as mighty leaf - but it is very good.  Would buy again."
2,"These little buggers are tough to find so I was happy to get a big pack at a good price online.  My daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at 2 calories a piece, not all that unhealthy."
1,"Is it a juice or is it a soda?  It's both!  Switch Kiwi Berry canned beverage has enough carbonation for it to be ""soda-like"" but it's not overpowering.  This particular flavor is made up of a variety of fruit juices, and I really didn't taste too much kiwi or strawberry.  To me, the apple juice flavor was the dominant one.  I like fruit juices and different beverage choices, and I really like the texture of this drink.  However, it is a bit too sweet for my liking and is pretty high in calories.  If the calorie count had been lower, my rating would be higher.  Children would probably really enjoy this drink, and it's definitely a healthier option than soft drinks or other sugary options.  I'd be interested to try some of the other flavors!"
0,"Many food establishments serve Chna Mista tea and I love<br />the flavor, I was happy to be able to purchase it on Amazon.<br />I make it my iced tea maker it's so easy and has a great<br />taste with less caffeine. Try it you will love it too."
2,"Let me start by saying my 7 month old son, who is used to my home prepared baby foods LOVES this, as a once in a blue moon convenience meal! I've tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too. Rare in the baby food industry.<br /><br />I am following a weaning guide that I used for my daughter, and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland, watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made, healthy meals, resulting in picky toddlers and children. My daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet, and I attribute that to the hard work I put in in the first year. Another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs aren't fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger.<br /><br />I'd love to ask, who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets, though? My son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much ""fuller"", so I've had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume. And it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water, so I add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little. Before long, I'm sure he'll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when I give him this.<br /><br />All that said, I'll reiterate, it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food, and I have no problem giving it to my son once in a while. I do recommend!"
1,"I enjoyed this drink.  It has a tangy citrus flavor which tasted a little less orangy than I expected, but was still good.  I liked the carbonation in the juice - it was about the right amount for me.  The drink has about the same calories as a regular soda, but I feel better about drinking it because of the natural ingredients.  The drink does not have the syrupy feel of a traditional orange soda which is a bonus.  This is definitely a lighter tasting, very refreshing drink.  The only reason for reducing the star value by one was because of the price which is a bit extravagant for me.  I recommend this drink."
0,"Twinings is a great tea maker. And their Earl Grey is the best IMHO. I love to save money, especially when buying K-cups. You can buy a 25 pack for $9.99 at the Twinings USA website. Buying 2 packs plus shipping is still less than the $30 advertised here.(depending on where you live). So if your a fan, buy from the source. Happy Hunting! And also a place called [...] has good prices too. I don't represent any of these websites, I am giving back to consumers, because we sometimes pay too darn much for things. Pay it Forward and share good value! Smiles..."
0,"I bought this tea as an alternative to very pricey Teavana Black Teas. I have a cup every morning, very smooth refreshing tea."
1,"I have reviewed three different flavors of Switch. This one, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Of the three flavors by favorite, by far, is the Black Cherry. It had a much more mild taste and didn't seem nearly as sweet as this one. If you like a lot of kick in your juice, and an almost over powering flavor this one may be for you. However, that is not what I was looking for.<br /><br />I much prefer the Black Cherry over the other two."
1,"Sierra Mist Diet Cranberry Splash is the best tasting soda to be released.  I've enjoyed it for several weeks now, but can't find it anywhere in the St. Louis market presently."
3,"I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I don't drink coffee and I was searching for more hot chocolates for my Keurig. I am a Milk Chocolate fan, but with Grove Square the Peppermint and Dark Chocolate are by far the better choice.Both have a sweetness I wasn't expecting. The flavor is great and I don't want to share. I am definitely reordering more."
0,this is a very good earl grey tea and i would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a quality tea
1,"I really enjoyed the Switch Kiwi Berry.  I was looking for an alternative to soda and this really filled that niche for me.  This flavor was very pleasant in my opinion, but that is a personal thing that everyone will have to decide on their own.  The Switch is 100% juice so you can feel good about giving it to your family and it is carbonated so the kids will think they are getting soda, a win win situation! Although it may be a little high in sugar, that is because it is fruit juice, not because it is loaded with corn syrup etc etc.<br />I would recommend this product and feel very comfortable giving it to my grandaughter."
1,"I really enjoyed this soda. I used to be a big fan of Orangina a few years ago but Switch Orange Tangerine is WAY better -especially if your looking for a true orangey taste. A cold one of these would be very refreshing on a hot summer day. Tastes sort of like real orange juice mixed with seltzer, which begs the question why not just mix it yourself? (if your at home that is). But I wouldn't hesitate buying one of these when out and about. Very tasty."
0,"This is the same tea they serve at PF Chang's.<br />If you like tea, you must try this, 5 star tea, excellent!"
1,"I am definitely a mom who wants to limit the amount of ""junk"" food in our home, including sodas, so I was intrigued by a new natural fruit drink with carbonation. We have had other natural carbonated beverages and enjoyed them, but the family would still choose plain old juice or Sunkist soda over any of these when given the choice.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry Switch has had the same reception. The family finds it to be okay, but nothing that will make them trade in their favorites. It is a fruit drink with light carbonation, more natural than most traditional soda, but still just as sugary, even if the sweetness is primarily from natural fruit sugars. Therefore, I find little reason to encourage them to Switch.<br /><br />Its taste reminded me of the old Strawberry Crush from when I was a kid, but not quite a potent. It is pleasant enough, but as my son put it ""I would drink it if it were all that we had in the fridge but I would not ask you to buy it again"". Also, I am not necessarily sure it is  worth the cost of nearly $1 per can (a small can compared to traditional soda).<br /><br />Bottom line: We have tried other natural sodas that we found better tasting and less expensive. It's not bad, so it might be worth a try to see which of the natural brands your family likes best. Don't expect it to replace soft drinks for those in the family that really enjoy them, and don't expect it to be a great, healthy alternative since it is still high in carbs/sugar."
2,"My 14 month old son is CRAZY about solids. :)  It isn't always convenient to be carrying fresh fruits and veggies around with me so these are a great alternative. He loves playing with them and feeding himself without getting his hands all sticky.  He especially likes it when he finds a blueberry!  These are great. Organic, non-GMO, and really neat & convenient. I couldn't ask for more."
0,"When I write a review on teas I am always hesitant to either fully recommend any given tea, or conversely, to recommend that it not be touched with a ten foot pole and that it is not fit for human consumption.  The reason for this is taste.  We are all different in this area and what may be an absolute delight for me, may quite well be another's gastronomical bane. Finding the ""just right tea;"" the tea that is the beginning and the end for the lover of tea is an adventure and in my opinion, an adventure that should last a life time.  I started drinking tea (we are talking hot tea here) as a small child, as did my wife, and we have been together on our search for well over 50 years now.  I have to tell you that the trip has been wonderful!<br /><br />Now a person can sink a lot of money into their tea habit and hobby over the years.  Nothing is worse (well, I suppose many things are indeed worse...I just use this as an expression) than to spend a King's Ransom on a large amount of new tea(s) that you want to try and find that you find you cannot stand the stuff!  We have found in recent years a bit of a solution to this problem in these ""variety packs"" offered by many companies - Twinings being the leader in this marketing method.  We get to sample different varieties and blends, in this case four separate blends, without having to sell our first born into bondage to be able to afford it.  The other upside to this variety pack, as with many like packs, is that you get several tea bags of the same blend so that you have plenty to make your mind up with.  We never try just one cup or one brew as taste can change from day to day as well as moods; and trust me, when it comes to tea drinking, moods and attitude do count!<br /><br />With this variety pack you get a nice sampling of English breakfast, Earl Grey, Lady Grey and Irish breakfast teas to sample.  All of these teas are of the black variety; all are different and all have a nice full-bodied presents which is ideal if dark full-bodied teas are ""your thing.""<br /><br />Even this pack though will show the difference in taste.  I am fond of the English breakfast tea (My favorite if this selection), where as my wife favors the Lady Grey.<br /><br />This is a good selection to simply get to know four nice blends.  If you brew it correctly, use good quality water and let yourself relax and be as objective as possible, I should think you will be pretty happy with it...or maybe not.  I personally liked it.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"
1,"This is a very good tasting carbonated juice drink that makes a great alternative to soda.  There is not an overload of carbonation.  Just enough to make it taste more like orange soda.<br /><br />It's made with 100% juice (more apple and grape than orange, surprisingly), it has 100% RDA Vitamin C, it's all natural with no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and it's gluten free.<br /><br />The flavor of the drink I tested was called orange tangerine, and it was an 8.3 fl. oz. can, with 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that I really cannot picture myself paying for it.  It's rather expensive in comparison to the orange juice I buy at the grocery store, and if I want an alternative to regular soda I would go with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIR6C"">Blue Sky Jamaican Ginger Ale, 12-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>.  Now, THAT is good!  However, if you're looking for an orange-flavored soda-substitute THIS is your product.  100% juice; how could you go wrong."
1,"As others have said this drink is 100% natural and contains none of the things that we don't want in soda.  My family really enjoyed it.  I thought it had a great bubbly and fruity taste.  None of us found it overly sweet.  We're not big soda drinkers, but this would be fun on a hot day as something different."
1,"Having now tried several Switch drinks, I'm quite pleased with how they've chosen to enter the market with this product-line. The flavors they've introduced are well thought out, generally taste good, and are really a good set of drinks I'd consider purchasing.<br /><br />The downsides? It's probably not big enough. 8.3 ounces is quite small. I know it's probably more of a specialty drink, but I did feel like I still needed more after drinking the entire can. It's possible they intended that to make you purchase more.<br /><br />That being said the black cherry was by far my most favorite. Again, these are great drinks. Definitely worth trying and seeing if they can become a part of your regular drink selection."
4,Couldn't find in the description where this was pate.  My cat generally will not eat pate but one can down so we will see.  It would be nice if this was included in the description. - 1/24/2012
0,Lipton tea is around $6.75 in the local gorcery store if you cand find it.
1,"The Switch Orange Tangerine looked very promising. 100% juice, with some zippy carbonation. I placed it in the fridge, and let it get a nice chill. Hours later, I popped the top, and my wife and I sampled...<br /><br />And it tasted like drinking furniture polish. It's not like we we're searching for derogatory statements about Switch. Here is how the conversation went:<br /><br />Wife takes a swig, looks at me with eyes all googled. ""Yuck. It tastes like furniture polish.""<br /><br />I take the can from her, thinking she must be insane. I chug some down. ""Ah, yeah...it does taste like furniture polish.""<br /><br />We poured the remainder down the drain. If you enjoy drinking cold tangerine flavored furniture polish, by all means...<br /><br />BTW, this drink left a nasty aftertaste...still belching it up."
2,I used this variety pack to introduce protein into my daughter's diet.  She loves all four of the varieties!
2,"My 1 year old son does really like these- andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks.  The only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in, so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go."
4,"My aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available. However, she has absoloutely no problems with this. Not once in all the months i've been feeding her this has she ever vomited in any way. Not to mention she's acting healthier and seems stronger on this brand.<br /><br />And she easily eats this dry without having to add any wet food to make it palatable. She clearly likes the taste.<br /><br />All in all I highly recommend this to anyone with a senior cat."
0,"This tea was fine...just not my favorite.  I prefer flavored herbal teas, but tried this for regular tea.  It has an unusual flavor, but I do like it for something different."
3,"Very good hot chocolate.  I have tried a few different brands, and this one is the best I have tried.  Should be priced higher for the quality you get."
0,I loved this tea! It is refreshing and delicious with or without sweetener. A great buy! I would definitely recommend this product!
1,"Sometimes you want a refreshing change to plain water, and this does the trick.  I could imagine adding a splash of gin or vodka on days you sort of want to be bad (smile)."
0,The price was excellent and the tea arrived quickly.  This is where I will be buying my tea in the future.
0,"I drank this tea while on trips to Russia and Ukraine.  I was so happy to find it for a reasonable price- in my previous searches, it was ridiculously expensive.  You get a LOT of tea in this container.  This is ceylon tea, and it is very, very good.  I highly recommend!"
0,"This is the best green tea I have ever tried. It is subtle, yet has a nice aftertaste that is both refreshing and relaxing"
0,"I am a devoted coffee drinker, but I was served this unusual tea at a spa and instantly became a fan.  If you don't like licorice, please still try it.  Most people including myself don't identify it as having licorice flavor, just a very soothing peppermint tea with a hint of mysterious sweetness.  Try it!"
2,"Our 15mo old daughter has really liked most of the other Happy Baby foods (she LOVES the Gobble-Gobble & Mango-Spinach-Pear).  However, this one makes her throw up EVERY time!  She is not allergic to anything in the ingredients - I can only guess that the high tomato content is just too acidic for her tummy."
1,"This juice is actually concentrated as advertised. Of all the juice concentrates of any flavor i have tried, this one is the most concentrated, and i expected the others to be as concentrated but they were all thin. I guess tart cherry juice tastes like fresh black cherries in general, but Montmorency RTCJ has the more tart best flavor!"
3,I am very pleased with this selection.  I have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for Keurig but this one is awesome!  I bought the milk chocolate.
2,"We love happybaby products, our twins like most of them.  Unfortantely this is nothing like the others.  Very dry, paste like.  Babies refused to eat it."
0,"It's my recipient's favorite.  However, I sent it expedited handling and it took from Monday to Friday to arrive.  The cookbook, Cooking With Tea, which was to accompany the Bengal Spice Tea, arrived in about 10 days and had to be forwarded from California to Oregon as the recipient had already returned.  It wasn't the tea, it was the s & h that was disappointing.<br /><br />Marilyn Russell"
0,"I bought two kinds of Davidson's bulk teas, Darjeeling and Gunpowder Green, and I was very disappointed in the quality. They both make kind of a murky harsh tea. The Darjeeling is very light in color and has an aftertaste more like pekoe. The Gunpowder Green is weak and flat. I certainly wouldn't recommend them."
4,"My female Pixie Bob cat, Pawnee, is extremely finicky about her canned food.  She will touch nothing but Instinct's rabbit formula, and licks her plate clean each morning.  The Instinct brand is nothing but the best, whether it is a canned formula or dry."
1,"I don't know how to describe 'Switch Orange Tangerine' without sounding like a cliche advertising slogan, but the truth is it REALLY IS very refreshing.  Just the right amount of carbonation too.  This stuff tastes like what you would get if you squeezed part tangerine and part orange and then poured in a bit of sparkling soda.  Very fresh tasting.  Not too sweet at all.  The label says there is no sugar added.  Fine, as it doesnt need any.  The label also says it has Apple and Grape juice. I taste mostly the tangerine myself but you may find your mileage varies.  Finally, it is supposed to give you a full days worth of vitamin C.  Ok,a LOT of drinks can do that nowdays, but without any refined sugar of high fructose corn syrup? (or artificial sweetener?)  I could totally see replacing my orange soda with this stuff.  I have not seen this in the market yet, but I would be willing to try other flavors and add Switch to the many beverages I enjoy.  Really, for a fruit drink, it is pretty darn good!"
1,"I enjoyed these so much, I ordered a separate bag of each flavor. Pineapple and strawberry are the best. The kiwi are #1 in the house. Try them all in this one bag."
3,great product for keurig coffee maker. works fine with coffees and cocoa mixtures. Is good for just hot chocolate. like purchase price
4,"The ingredients are good and my cat loves it. She's never walked away from it, so I was very surprised when my son's cats did. I decided to rate it from my cat's point of view."
0,"I could not wait to get my tea in the mail!  My favorite type of tea is Oolong for it's fruity, sweet flavor.  And then add peach to this?!  AWESOME!  What a great blend!  I think the peach may be a little too over powering of the Oolong, but I still love this tea.  Not to mention, it's fresh.  You can always tell if tea is too old.  This tea was really really fresh.<br /><br />Loose leaf tea is usually pricey, and Oolong is even pricer.  I usually can only afford 2 or 4 oz at a time.  But this tea is a HUGE bargain!  I feel like I got a huge deal.  I opened the sealed bag (also comes with a resealable ziplock just inside) and was so surprised by how much tea is in here.  This is going to last me a long time - yay!  It says it's 8 ounces, but looking at it, it seems like it's more like 12 ounces.  Maybe it's my imagination?<br /><br />This is my first time buying Boston Tea, but I don't think it will be my last.  I'm excited to try more teas by them."
3,"We got Mexican Nesquik because it was cheaper, but I was surprised when it actually tasted different and better than the US version.  It has a darker chocolate taste which I really like."
0,"I love this tea. The flavor is heavenly and the tea bags look like a lovely sachet of poupourri, not a regular tea bag. It's such a pleasing statement, visually, aroma, and flavor. I've given this tea as gifts."
0,"This is a very good tea as far as teabags go...traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas, But this is the exception...being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas(White tea is the least processed of all teas)...teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of...these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas(the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance)... and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money...It took about six weeks to finally get delivered, but it was worth the weight...This one is a no brainer...!!!"
3,"I meant to order Anthony Berg's chocolates and got this one by mistake...yikes, not a good outcome.  The chocolate is poor and the gel-like liquor is worse...don't make the mistake that i made..."
1,"The SWITCH ORANGE TANGERINE SODA doesn't taste too bad and it is carbonated, but the taste reminded me of orange juice that went sour. You know, when the O.J. has gone way past the expiration date and you gulp some and it has that bitter acidic taste.<br /><br />Anyway, the soda is made from a combination of apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice, and doesn't add sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or artificial colors. It's also gluten free so that's good news for those who are trying to watch what they eat and drink.<br /><br />The 8.3-ounce can is smaller than the standard 12-ounce can of soda and maybe it just takes a couple of tries to get used to the flavor.<br /><br />Like I said, not bad but I'll stick with regular/diet soda. But for a healthier alternative for soda lovers, I suggest trying one of the ""SWITCH SODAS"" OR any naturally flavored sparkling water."
3,This is by far the best hot cocoa I have found yet for the Keurig. I love the assortment and the peppermint is my favorite. I would give these try for sure if you are looking for some hot cocoa K-cups. All the other selections for hot cocoa that I have tried were just okay tasting. These are AMAZING!!!! LOVE THEM! I will order these for sure again!
3,This is the best Hot Cocoa product I have found for the Keurig K-cup Brewer. The others I have tried do not have the test or alot of the product remains in the cup.
0,This tea is sooo good and you are drinking pure organic -  That is a good thing- I've tried other brands of loose tea and there is no comparison to the taste quality -  This is really good<br />All you need is a tea ball - and time to relax -<br />Try it - This Earl Grey is a keeper-
3,"I purchased this product because of the reviews I read and I'm so glad I did.  I love it.  If your looking for a good hot chocolate this is it.  Sweet, spicy chocolate...very good."
1,"I bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because I see it everywhere. It was nasty. I will never drink this crap again, I don't care how ""good"" it is for you. The taste is disgusting and I'd rather just drink regular water. Blah!"
1,Switch is a fantastic replacement for sodas. You still enjoy having the carbonation but with fruit juice. It is very satisfying.
2,"Something different that the adults and children alike can enjoy.  Better than chips, pretzels and candy - health wise.  Had never heard of this product sold in a ""ready to eat"" form and to find one so tasteful thrilled us all.  Chestnuts were always a winter treat for us but they are difficult to peel - not these, they are roasted and peeled for us.  Grab a few, settle in for an evening of TV watching.  BTW, they are great in a stuffing recipe for that seasonal turkey dinner - the Big One.  I am on a ""purchase"" a box bi-monthly and had to step it up to once a  month.  You will never be sorry purchasing these."
3,I think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery. My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa. Not sure I will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups. Sometimes I think you are better off buying Swiss Miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine.
4,"My sister gave her cats these and loved them, so I got them for my cats. Our 4 cats have been vomiting a lot lately, and we traced it back to these treats. Google whiskas temptations recall...they were recalled not too long ago and I don't know why they are still on shelves. Don't buy these... They will make your cat sick and who know what else it's doing to their internal system. Please keep your cats away from this product!"
3,"I'm dieting, and I use these as a ""treat"" to myself, when I'm craving chocolate.  I usually brew one of these & one of my coffee K-cups (either plain or hazelnut).<br /><br />For 60 calories, it's not a bad way to satisfy a chocolate craving when you're on a ""calorie-budget!"""
0,"contrary to all of the glowing reviews this is the worst Earl Grey tea I've ever had - and that is comparing against bagged tea from the grocery store in addition to other loose leaf brands.<br /><br />The smell is way too perfume like yet still a bit pleasant, but the taste is nothing like the smell.  Way too astringent for me - yuck.  I've tried various weights and water temps to no avail.  The first steeping is not good, the second is more drinkable for me, 3rd steeping is not worth the effort.<br /><br />I've choked down the first can and a half.  I'm going to gift the 3rd unopened can to someone who might enjoy it more than myself.<br /><br />This tea is so bad I wonder if Rishi is all marketing, packaging, and setting price points to brand a sub-par product and then have a team post positive reviews all over the net.  I'm not saying its so, but it does make one wonder . . .<br /><br />2 stars only because I didn't horque it up."
0,This tea is awesome.  You have to keep stirring it if it sits too long but the taste is great.  Little prep time- keeps me going all day.
1,"Mix this half and half with Orange Crush over ice and it tastes just like a creamiscle.  It's very yummy, but gets you drunk pretty quickly."
0,"This Rishi Earl Grey seems to be better than other brands that I have tried in the past.  (In the past, I have tried other brands like The Coffee Bean & The Tea Leaf, Twinings, and few others easily found in my local supermarket.)  The fragrance is very nice without becoming overpowering and it tastes smooth and light.<br /><br />If you want to make the brew 'heavier', try adding 'heavier' tea like Yorkshire Tea (I think other English Breakfast Tea types should work as well), although do not add too much or it may become too strong, unless you want to also add milk.  Although I have not tried yet, I am considering mixing this Early Grey with Assam sometime in the future.  Experiment, experiment, and experiment."
3,Grove Square hot chocolate is very tasty.  I was searching for The Swiss Miss brand and the search pulled up this one. The price was right so I ordered some with hopeful expectations and was pleasantly surprised at Grove Squares wonderful chocolate creamy taste even on the large cup Koerig setting. You won't be disapointed
0,"I have tried many brands and types of tea and this is one of the best. It has a very spicy taste and is refreshing. I believe you can not go wrong purchasing any Good Earth tea, but this is probably their best."
4,"Both of my cats vomit from all Temptations treats, but especially the Hairball variety. One of my cats actually is getting hairballs from these treats when he didn't before. I've tried all of them, and minutes after they eat their treats they vomit. This doesn't happen with any other treats like Whisker Lickins or Pounce."
1,"All of the Switch drink flavors taste good and go down refreshing, but this was the one that made me skeptical until I opened the can. It does taste like fresh tangerines, and the flavor is bright and not weak or watery. There's just enough fizz to add some interest, but none of the bad stuff people like to avoid in a soda: you know, artificial flavors and colors, preservatives and all that. It's just juice with fizz. In fact, it's good juice with fizz!"
1,"Switch, with it's 100% RDA of Vitamin C, and it's lack of added sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives, is not only healthy, but it has the nice twist of carbonation to appeal to soda drinkers young and old.<br /><br />This is a great beverage for soda-lovers--children and adults alike, as well as for health foodies looking for something a little different. It's an especially great product for kids, because they think they are getting soda, but it's really just fancy juice that's (GULP!) good for them!<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry flavor is sweet, but it's a natural flavor that derives its sweetness from fruit juices. Overall, it's definitely an enjoyable product."
4,"my very VERY fussy cats gobbled up the chicken flavored ones, along with the med inside it! and my cats don't even like their regular food changed. still can't believe it was so easy! used to try everything including tuna with oil (no luck) but i followed the other comments and made sure i molded it around the med so it didn't show. it took one lick or two and then gobble! i gave them an extra as a treat too. THANKS GREENIES"
0,"I love this tea. I've been drinking it for a couple of years and it's my favorite. It has eucalyptus and menthol and ginger, making it quite flavorful. You can drink it without sugar or with some honey. Best in the winter amd especially when you feel a cold coming on. My mom who has asthma loves it because it seems to have an expectorant ability. I ordered the six pack with a subcription because i use the tea at work. I drink a cup daily so that i feel the need to drink less coffee. Highly recommend it!"
1,"This is a great fruit soda, will surprise you if you are used to artificially flavored junk.<br /><br />BUT... It's much cheaper in supermarkets. Trader Joe's, as noted above, sells it for under $3 in a four-pack.<br /><br />There also exists an all-natural version without the preservative or artificial colors, that is sold in Whole Foods. Side by side it tastes a little better, but is more expensive. I prefer it."
3,GREAT! Hot Chocolate! By far the best Kcup hot chocolate I have found. I use a little milk or half and half and it's so..... good. I definitely will order again! Thanks for the super FAST SHIPPING!
4,"These are the only cat treats that do not make my cat sick. Nothing, and I mean nothing else worked. I enjoy giving her a treat each day and this allows me to do it. When we moved from FL to CO, my vet didn't have them. I was so relieved to find them online.  I will definitely be back when we run out!!"
3,"This is the perfect cocoa to sit by a fire/listen ot the rain/cuddle next to your loved ones. I had to order it on amazon, since it was only available in UT where I used to live. I'm so glad I ordered it!  Choc  Rasp is the best flavor but Chocolate Hazelnut, Chocolate Mint, and Milk Chocolate are also excellent."
1,"100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't is proudly emblazoned upon the can that contains Switch's Orange Tangerine carbonated juice. It certainly tasted all-natural, as there wasn't too much taste really.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it was all right, but I would say it tasted kind of like Sprite with a couple of orange flavored Alka-Seltzers tossed in. Another note is that it is rather small at only just over 8 ounces. However, it still had enough orange taste I suppose, so if you want an all-natural mild orange flavored carbonated juice drink, then you've just hit the jack-pot!<br /><br />If not, you may want to pass this up, mildly recommended."
4,"My cat absolutely loves these things. The only downside to them is that they will dry out after a while. Other than that, they're great healthy cat snacks."
0,In the description of the tea it lists all organic ingredients.  The tea I received only one of the ingredients is organic.<br />I will say that Amazon was awesome in responding and refunding.  But I do think this tea should not be listed as Organic.
3,"i love this spicy chocolate. it's perfect for anytime. the best way to make it, is to heat your milk on the stove and add the chocolate as it is warming. i also add some whipped cream to my cup with a sprinkle of chili powder on the top. love to curl up and just relax with a warm cup."
0,"As an avid tea drinker of all corners of the earth, I have had hundreds of teas, and everything from this company as well. I read about this tea as a very powerful health herb but all the reviews said it tastes bad. What do I care? I'd rather be healthy. I never take sugar in my tea either. If you've read this far you are waiting for me to say how bad it was. You can't imagine how bad it is. Without exaggeration I would describe the flavor as a very bitter tasting dirt. Yes, as a 32 year old with children I know what dirt tastes like and this tastes like dirt but with a super bitter taste that makes it hard to drink. My recommendation is to let it steep for a shorter amount of time as to not make a rich bold tea. As you know, the longer it steeps the bolder the tea becomes. Yea, don't do that with this. Four stars because it is apparently very good for you and I thank the company for bringing it to us regardless of the taste of death when other tea companies are using Artificial ingredients to make their teas taste better."
2,"Our daughter (now 10 months) is a relatively good eater, but this has been one of her favorites for a few months now. It's a simple combination, but she finishes the packet each time (which is good because the package isn't resealable)! We make food for her too, but we like having these organic pouches as an easy option for travel and for the days we just want something quick."
2,"My baby is a wonderful eater and has loved all of the variety I've given him until this food. He tried it and vomited instantly. I tried the next day and just let him smell it and he vomited again - lol. I tried it too and it was not tasty to me at all. I had two of these packs left so I waited a couple of weeks to try again. He liked it that time. Anyway, don't give up and keep trying because they just may like it after a few tries (or even 15 tries). It's a healthy meal."

4,"These guys are quite high on the nutritional scale but on these marinated morsels varieties, well, they hate them.  They get stuck in my cats' teeth and although it can be quite comical watching them afterwards, it just ins't worth them only eating about half a can and tossing the rest down the garbage disposal.  I recommend them for the nutritional value and please try them if you cat loves chicken.  My rescue loves many of the other varieties and this stuff has improved her quality of life tremendously. Recommend!"
0,"Probably my favorite tea.  Lady Grey is similar to Earl Grey, the bergamot is subtler but it still has plenty of flavor.  I prefer loose tea over tea bags with strings. Lady Grey in the tin is VERY hard to find.  As I much as I love it, a 6 pack is a LOT of tea, I wish I could buy individual tins."
0,"A delicate aroma greeted me when I opened the can of this tea. The flavor was different than that of any other Earl Grey tea I've tried. This is the reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 - basically it's not what I expected. Perhaps bergamot citrus was what set it apart from other companies. However though it's different it was very good. Tangy and flavorful, it seemed to get better with every sip. I don't usually add anything to the tea (no sugar, sweeteners, milk, etc.), but this tea in particular truly didn't need any additions. I am planning to try other teas from Rishi."
1,"My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the soda ""Orange Crush,"" although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike ""Orange Crush,"" this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 140 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created a 12 ounce can and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase it.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series."

1,"I love these Switch ""sodas"" they are very tasty and do not contain any bad ingredients. I love to drink soda and when I go to the store I can never find any without high fructose corn syrup. These switch sodas are very easy drinking but contain NO HFCS! For that reason alone I give this a 5 star. The can size is kind of small compared to what we Americans are used to drinking 16 oz soda is the standard size here in the US. These are 1/2 that size and a quick swig can knock it out.<br /><br />The kiwi-strawberry flavor is very yummy. I highly recommend this to everyone looking for an alternative to other sodas.<br /><br />Calories: 120;<br />Fat: 0;<br />Sodium 15mg;<br />Total Carbohydrates 31g;<br />Sugar 24g;<br />Protein 0g;<br />Vitamin C 100%"
4,"When I run out of these, my dog reluctantly eats other treats, but I can tell she is not happy.  My cats even try to steal them from her.<br /><br />It's hard to find good quality pet snacks without a lot of additives and grain free.  These Dogswell brand are the best."
4,"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0"">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>"
3,"The Chocolate Mocha flavor of this Hot Cocoa is really nice. It's different from the usual Hot Cocoa since it has a hint of Coffee. The quality is definitely there, I find it to be better then the Godiva brand. Mixes extremely easily, there is no residue and works with milk or even water mixed with half and half. I must say that it is a bit much of the same flavor, I would have rather 4 different flavors since the containers are big. Worth it though! A++"
0,I love this tea. Full bodied and malty. The packaging has a ziploc top to keep it fresh. Very nice tea for a heavy tea drinker.
3,"When I bought my Keurig brewer, I eagerly looked for other beverage options for my wife who is not a coffee drinker.  I'm still looking.  The Grove Square Hot Cocoa had a nasty aftertaste, almost metallic.  No amount of cleaning/tinkering with the brewer made any improvement.  I used the brewer to make hot water for a Nestle Hot Cocoa pack, and that was a far superior beverage.  The Grove Square quickly found it's way to the trash.  I'll find quality mixes and use the Keurig to heat the water from now on."
0,"after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be ""ginseng for women"" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to ""draw one's energy"" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's ""good for you"" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?"
4,"Why is it so hard to find rabbit-based cat food??<br /><br />I like to give my cat variety in his diet; his main foods are mostly poultry, but I like to keep the fish and red meat to a minimum.  After my last cat was diagnosed with diabetes I did a lot of in-depth research on feline diets.  One veterinarian who's written extensively about homemade cat foods was fond of using rabbit as a poultry alternative because it's closest to what a small cat would eat in the wild.  It's particularly excellent to supplement a diet when the cat is sensitive to fish (as many are).  It's also higher in fat than fish - many fish-based foods I looked at only took 15 to 20% of their calories from fat, and a cat needs more than that.<br /><br />This food fits the bill!  It's got an excellent ingredient list.  It's grain-free, which is what I consider to be the most important qualification, and doesn't contain animal ""meal"" or by-products.<br /><br />There are three reasons I'm giving it four stars instead of five.  First, it's expensive.  Rabbit meat, by weight, is going to be pricey, so I'm not surprised...but just because I think it's worth the price doesn't mean I wouldn't like to pay less!  Second, my cat isn't crazy about it.  It's got a ground texture and he's very fussy about only eating shredded meat.  I solved this by mixing a 3 oz can of this food with a 3 oz can of shredded chicken (of a different brand) and he gobbled it up.  I just wish I didn't have to take that extra step.  Finally, it's awfully dry.  It was actually a surprise.  The meat itself is very dry, and the liquid in the can is totally separated.  I think most cat foods use thickeners so that the gravy clings to the meat, and this one doesn't.  Since one of the many advantages of canned food is that it helps to keep the cat hydrated - they have a low thirst drive and are built to take in much of their fluids with their food - I was a bit disappointed.  And surprised the first time I tipped what looked like a can full of meat too far to the side and ended up with watery cat food juice on my hand and the kitchen floor!  But this was also solved by mixing it with a chicken-in-gravy food.<br /><br />Those complaints aren't enough to keep me from buying this food, though.  It's still a great cat food with a hard-to-find protein source and a good ingredient list.  It's a bit expensive for me to use as a main food, but a can or two a week gives just the right amount of variety."
1,"I like sparkling water a lot.  Perrier is usually my first choice but sometimes I want something a little more then the fruit flavored seltzer water.  This drink fits the bill nicely.  It contains all natural fruit which is a big plus over the fruit flavored options.  It contains some calories but since it is from a natural source and not just plain sugar, I'm okay with it.  This beverage is in a slimmer can with only 8.3 oz versus the usual 12 ozs of say, a can of soda so you save a few calories but not much.  It hits the spot when I want something sweeter then plain mineral water and it's healthier then soda.<br /><br />I've tried other sparkling fruit drinks with lower satisfaction marks.  Most of them claim to be ""all natural"" but list funky ingredients such as ""natural flavorings""  Huh?  This beverage lists ingredients that are easily defined.  Also, it avoids the overly sweet taste of other  similar produts.  This one stands out as a winner but less calories would make it perfect.  I guess you cannot have everything...."
2,I love Plum organic pouch.  Got this one on sale.  My baby and toddler LOVE this so much.  My 3 years old always ask me for more.
0,"I love Earl Grey tea, but I'm trying to avoid caffeine. I was happy to find the Twinings Decaf Earl Grey tea, because locally I can only get herbal tea K-cups if I want to go caffeine-free. I have had the Twinings brand Earl Grey tea (with caffeine) in both tea bags and in a Tassimo T-disc. The K-cup version of their Earl Grey tea seems to have a much stronger bergamot taste than the other versions. I like my tea on the weak side, so I brew on the 10 oz. or 12 oz. setting - even so, the bergamot taste is still very strong (almost too much). If you are looking for Earl Grey K-cups and don't mind caffeine, I would try the Celestial Seasonings or Bigelow brands - they are better. If you are trying to avoid caffeine, these will give you more options and although not great - they still make a decent drink."
1,It may be all natural but it didn't have a natural taste to me.  The can size is small and the calories were more than I thought there should be.  I like the mild carbonation ok but I wouldn't switch from orange juice.
1,"Switch markets itself as an alternative to soda.  It is essentially carbonated fruit juice with no added sweeteners.  I do agree that if you are a person who drinks a lot of soda or have  child who does, switching to his would be the better alternative.<br />BUT - this drink is not healthy by any means, the amount of fruit juice required for it's tastiness results in a HIGH sugar and calorie content for a fruit juice.  You would not want to drink 5 of these in a day and the better option would be a piece of fruit with less calories and sugar."
3,I was skeptical about buying this because all of the other hot cocoa items I've purchased for the Keurig have been awful. I was pleasantly pleased with this!  It is simply delicious!  I will definitely reorder!
0,"Certainly a great British tea product. Traditionally, such products come to the customers with at least one to two years for shelf life freshness. This end-of-the-2009-year purchase (six big boxes!) provided me with the product expiring in June 2010. Somewhat short of my expectations; all the more so, expiration dates are clearly written on the boxes and, I am sure, processing staff could easily note this."
1,"This soda sounded like a good idea, but it is just too sweet. The orange and tangerine juice is clear and bitter tangy but the sugar in this particular flavor is overwhelming to me. (On the other hand I liked the cherry very much.) I would drink it anyway, if it were offered, it certainly is not terrible. But I would not buy it again."
0,So glad to have found this tea...it's my absolute holiday favorite!  Thanks for the fast shipping too!
2,My daughter loves this!  She is picky so she doesn't always eat as many healthy foods as she should.  This flavor gives her the vegetables and protein that she needs.  It is a little bit grainier than other stage 2 foods but still very usable for babies over 6 months.
3,GROVE STREET HAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST HOT CHOCOLATE FOR THE KEURIG.  YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE HOT CHOCOLATE AVAILABLE TO SOOTHE AWAY THE DAYS ANXIETIES!
2,"These aren't as good as other bars of this type. My kids won't eat them, nor will my husband. They are all fond of the Nutrigrain variety, but I thought these would be a healthier alternative."
2,"I bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a very picky eater as of late.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veggie servings each day.  This does the trick!  He loves them and he can feed himself.  What more can I say?  (Oh, I actually tried one, and they really are good!)"
1,"The Kiwi Berry flavor has a tarty but sweet taste. Neither the strawberry nor kiwi is overpowering. Instead, I was treated to the best of both flavors! There was very little carbonation. My favorite Switch flavor!"
3,"Okay, so let me preface my review by saying that I don't drink hot chocolate that often and I'm from America and don't think I've ever had hot chocolate while traveling in Europe, BUT my husband is a British citizen who grew up in India with summers in England and he has searched HIGH and low for a chocolate drink that would remind him of those from his childhood.  We found it in this drink and he wont drink any other chocolate drink now (not even the 47 other kinds that are in my pantry that I bought for him to try and after 1 cup he turned his nose up at them... men)."
0,"There are several types of teas in the world indian ceylon scented teas like jasmine, there's oolong, black green, but one thing binds all these teas together, they taste like tea.<br /><br />This substance has no flavor only an astringent quality.  It is not drinkable plain.  Which I suppose is why people require all sorts of recipes adding sugar, or spices, anything to give this tea some flavor and take away the horrid bitterness.<br /><br />I think it's even worse than the bagged lipton tea if that is possible.  In the bagged tea, they don't put dust in the teabags because it would fall right out of the bag, but since this is loose tea, lipton saw fit to add dust, twigs, anything but the actual leaves.<br /><br />What should you drink?  Anything you like.  I suggest browsing this site called the English Tea Store (no affiliation) just to get an idea about what types of teas it is possible to purchase.<br /><br />I astounds me that anyone could drink this substance and call it ""tea"".  It is not tea, it is particles of bitterness, dust, pieces of twigs, black and tasteless leavings of what used to be a tea plant.<br /><br />What the hell is wrong with you people, to drink this stuff.  By the way I have nothing against some lipton tea, but when you drink this stuff you need to add lemon, sugar, or cream, something because it is awful stuff trying to drink it on its own.<br /><br />If you have to buy tea at a supermarket, try the twinings darjeeling that's a decent blend you can drink."
2,"This jar of baby food has 7 GRAMS of FAT and 110 calories - thats triple the fat and double the calories of most baby food!  I highly recommend for babies needing to put on some lbs - as well as picky eaters.  I have to offer my son a variety of 7-8 foods each meal (cheese, avacado, chunks of meat...etc) b/c he turns up his nose at so much (and I can't just say 'well too bad' b/c he desperately needs the calories!) But this is one of the foods he rarely turns down.  I highly recommend."
0,I love this tea. It's delicious and is one of my favorite teas. I like its aroma and taste. I drink it both after and between meals. Highly recommended.
3,"I love these hot chocolates. I think they're way better than the cafe express hot chocolates. These and the Swiss Miss hot chocolate are my favorite K-Cups. And the price of these are the best I've been able to find. My girlfriend and I have already gone through about half of them in about two weeks, and I never used to drink much hot chocolate.<br />I recommend these"
3,What a fun winter treat!  This is a perfect cup of cocoa in seconds!  We like to put a tablespoon or two of heavy whipping cream in the bottom of mug before brewing! A family favorite.
4,"This is the only flavor my cat will eat.  She goes<br />crazy over this flavor.  I think because it is easy<br />to eat instead of a big chunk.  This looks like little<br />square slices of beef.  It smells good too.  Whenever<br />I open a can of this, she comes running!  She's meowing<br />at me repeatedly if she sees the can in my hand, and I<br />imagine that she is saying ""Hey, hurry up and open that<br />can! I know what you got there.  You can't fool me.<br />Gimme that yummy food!""  But of course, she's saying<br />that in cat language.  Because I love her, I can totally<br />understand what she's saying.  What cat lover doesn't?<br />We definitely have that connection with our cats, don't<br />we?  To her, Tender Slices is the ultimate gourmet meal."
3,"This is absolutely delicious.  Because it is in powder form, you can make it as strong or weak as your taste buds allow.  I add instant Folger's to mine, making it into a mocha.  That also cuts the sweetness.  It really DOES taste like chocolate covered cherries -- a treat I have loved since childhood!<br /><br />I get mine through the ""subscription program"" along with several other flavors from Stephen's.  The subscription program works well for me since I travel. You can change the frequency AND the address to which it is to be sent as needed."
4,"Wellness Pure Delights are very tasty, moist and healthy that most of our finicky cats seem to enjoy. Definitely will buy more in the future."
2,"We love these baby food things in a little pouch. Sooooo much easier to feed to a baby or toddler on the go. Our son loves sucking the fruit out and we are pleased that it is both organic and healthy with nothing added - just fruit. For smaller ones, not good to let them handle it themselves, because they love to squeeze it, which gets things everywhere. But older ones can feed to themselves. I like the 3.17 size rather than the bigger one that Plum Organics has for some of the other flavors. It assures that he will eat all or most of it in one sitting rather than having to save some for later. You can also take this size on airplanes without having to have it tested for explosives - not the case with the bigger pouches. I also like that it is BPA free. If your little one likes them, ordering in bulk and with subscribe and save makes them much cheaper than at the store."
1,There is gum acacia in the list of ingredients.  Not sure if it adds anything to the flavor.  The orange and tangerine flavors do come through the fixx.  It seems to be a bit sweeter than orange juice.  Have achieved more satisfying and natural tasting fizzy juice drink by adding sparkling water to OJ.
0,I ordeed this product because this tea is really good. The shipment came as expected. I love the taste of this tea. It's not stong at all.
0,Good variety of tea. I only wanted one box but I figured the rest could be gifts for people. I like the earl greys out of it. Not a bog fan of the others but everyone has their own tatse. Quality is good. No complaints.
2,"I really wanted my kids to love it: these are very convenient on the go and should be delicious... or so it seemed. Unfortunately, none of the kids cared for it -- it tastes like stage 1 baby food (very bland) and is very runny too, so it can get quite messy if you squeeze a little too hard or if the child drops it."
4,"As much as one can tell with cats, mine seem to prefer this as their favorite."
0,"I love this tea, especially in the K-cup!  The flavor is delicate; the citrus note from the bergamot sets it apart from regular black tea.  And there is none of the mess I experience with tea bags!  I bought this to make my mother-in-law happy, but this has become my favorite evening drink."
1,"I suppose the flavor of this carbonated juice could be satisfying to someone, just not me.  If I were thirsty and no other drink was available, I would drink it, but even if I were to like the taste, when I want a drink, I almost always want more than the 8.3 ounces contained in the can.  (Why 8.3 ounces?)  I wonder if the market for this drink is for those who must religiously consume liquids in extreme moderation.  It must be quite hard to come up with a successful new drink product. The Switch Kiwi Berry may be a perfect demonstration of how hard it is.  Better luck next time."
1,"This drink tastes just like soda to me. Very strong and sweetened soda. It reminds me a lot of Fanta back in the day (1970s). I know it says it has all these vitamins and that it's healthy, but the flavor and amount of calories would keep me from buying this drink as a ""health drink"". There are plenty of vitamin and flavored waters and sports drinks that would serve the same purpose without all those calories. If I want a soda, I certainly wouldn't pay a lot of money for something that tastes just like it but costs 4 times as much (at a guess). I do love the taste of Fanta, though."
0,"Its my understanding (based on discussions with material scientists!) that nylon releases toxins when put into hot water..so..whats the deal with the nylon tea bags?  This wasn't stated anywhere or I wouldn't have bought them.  The company told me they wee FDA approved, but the FDA is only worried about things that will kill you in the short run, or that have very high levels of dangerous chemicals.  Trace amounts are permitted.  Considering how much tea I drink, I'd rather not add toxins to my body every single time.<br /><br />In contrast Might Leaf, while they have similar looking tea bags, theirs are not nylon and are biodegradable in addition to not being dangerous.<br /><br />Very disappointed in this product.  They should at least have been upfront about the nylon bags so concerned people can avoid buying them."
1,"I have read a couple of the studies on the anti-inflammatory potential of tart cherry juice, and became convinced that it's worth a try (as a 57-YO athlete).  I like this product b/c the label tells exactly how many cherries a tablespoon is equivalent to, so I can make an informed choices as to how much I use, based on the number-of-cherry equivalents in the studies I've read.  I can't vouch for the accuracy of the label, but I've no reason to doubt it.  I've grown to like the flavor, especially mixed with lime seltzer!"
4,"I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten dry formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.<br />He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!<br />I give him one small scoop of grain free kibble in the morning and then a partial can of this large 13oz Felidae grain free food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will eat anything I give him :-)). I bought some can lids at Petsmart, and they seal air tight on these cans - so fridge storage is clean and easy.<br /><br />He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy - we haven't had a single vet visit since I adopted him (even though he had chronic upper respiratory issues when I got him, they all cleared up). I have to blame at least SOME of all this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).<br /><br />I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or two of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!"
0,"this is a delicious tea, light and sweet with no aftertaste.  I highly recommend it to any tea drinkers who want a black tea, but one that is not too strong or bitter.  Needs no additional sweetening."
2,I was disappointed to receive Earth's Best Organic Snakin' Fruit Rings Banana because it hurt my child when she bit into the hard and stale treat.
1,"This is one of my favorite water add-ins. I think it has a really crisp, clean taste...with a hint of grassy-ness. The tea particles tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle, if left standing for more than a few minutes, so I have to shake it up periodically. There are times when I feel like I'm drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a lawnmower, but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener. It tastes great when I use stevia, but when I use Sweet & Low...I get a bitter-ish grassy taste."
4,"My cat, Mango, just loves this cat food.  It is the only brand of food that he will eat on a daily basis.  I have also purchased Fussie Cat brand ""Tuna with Salmon"" from Amazon.com and he loves this food also.  I try to alternate the food on a daily basis to give him variety."
1,"To quote from the Pure Fun website:<br /><br />  ""Today the flavor we call Pepsin is a form of Wintergreen [ . . . ] Pure Fun Pepsin is derived from Wintergreen plant extract [ . . . ] with the old-fashioned flavor we enjoyed in the 1950's and 60's.""<br /><br />Think of Wintergreen LifeSavers, and you'll know approximately what this candy tastes like (minus the chalky LifeSaver texture).  You may not like the taste, but the information about the dangers of real pepsin is not relevant to this candy.  The only reason I can imagine for Pure Fun to use the misleading name ""Pepsin"" would be if they are trying to associate the digestion-aiding properties of pepsin enzyme with this wintergreen candy.  Looks like they made a mistake."
1,"I sampled this product with some reservations. Carbonated fruit juice? My wife said that it would probably be something like Orangina, but since I'm not particularly fond of Orangina that didn't help me much. I then remembered that I had no problem drinking sparkling grape juice so this might not be so bad after all. I sampled this product cold, as warm fruit juice and warm soda are both bad ideas no matter what the flavor.<br /><br />I was very surprised to discover that I enjoyed this quite a bit. I expected there to be some acidity to it, given the orange and tangerine combination, and found none. I did find it surprisingly sweet considering that there's no added sugar. It was not, in fact, entirely unlike your garden variety orange soda with a smoother finish. There was a slight and very brief metallic aftertaste which I first assumed was from drinking it right from the can, but after a second taste from a drinking glass the aftertaste remained. Still, it's not enough to put me off from drinking it.<br /><br />The one thing that did put me off was the price. I'll admit that I'm something of a ""cheap drinker"" - I have a hard time, for example, going to the grocery store and buying a half gallon of lemonade for $2.50 when I can buy a $2 bottle of lemon juice and a $2.50 bag of sugar and make two gallons of lemonade and still have three pounds of sugar left over. I *always* do the math and price out what I'm drinking. (Do you have ANY idea how much money Coke makes off those 20 oz bottles?!?) So for this product, $23 for a 24-pack comes out to 96¢ per 8.3 ounce can, or about 12¢ per ounce. A half gallon of Tropicana orange-tangerine juice at the local supermarket is $3.80, or about 6¢ per ounce. I happen to have a carbonator and chargers are about 40 cents apiece, and it would take 2-3 chargers to do the entire half-gallon, so all said and done it would cost me about 8¢ per ounce to make my own carbonated orange-tangerine drink, so it's about 2/3 the cost to make it myself. (No, I didn't factor in the cost of the carbonator itself so that could be considered loading the dice.)<br /><br />So I guess the bottom line here is, if you're really big on the whole carbonated orange-tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed, or you can make a very close approximation of it yourself for about 65% of the cost (assuming you have a carbonator). Or, you can buy a two liter bottle of house-brand orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about $22 in the process."
3,Has just enough of the raspberry taste without being over bearing. Will purchase more in the future when my supple depletes.  I had trouble finding a good raspberry hot cocoa but now I know where to get it.  This site will be one of my favorites.
3,"I received the K-cups on time and in execellant condition. I usually drink coffee, but at night the Hot cocoa is good with a snack, just before bed."
0,The first time I tried this tea in the Japanese restaurant and fell in love to it.<br />It is my favorite tea.... I love it!

1,"This sparkling juice drink has a decent and refreshing flavor, though somewhat reminiscent of the canned orange juice (can't remember the brand) I had once in awhile as a kid.<br /><br />It's a nice idea to have a soda that has no added sugar, though the juice combination isn't as impressive as the name might sound. This beverage contains a mix of the following juices (reconstituted with sparkling water): apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. The beverage also includes gum acacia and soy.<br /><br />Despite the fact that there are no added sugars, the calorie and carb counts are quite high - in fact higher than an average soda. An 8.3 ounce can contains 140 calories and 36g carbs."
0,"Tazo Awake Full Leaf Tea is the best black tea I have ever tasted.  It is much better than the ground tea bags you would find in the grocery store (even of the same brand and type!).  It is very smooth, yet bold, delicious drank straight or with a splash of milk and a little sugar.<br /><br />The caffeine content is perfect to give you a little heart racing boost and get your day started.  I am not a coffee drinker so I use this as my morning wake up drink.  Love it and always have it on me, even when traveling."
2,"It is a tiny bit grainy .. but it doesn't bother me a bit, my kids really like it - I use this as a ""chocolate syrup"" substitute in my kids milk to make the box go further - they really love it - it's great drinking it full strength too.  Not too sweet.  We love it!"
0,"This is a great tasting oolong tea.  Light but rich in flavor!  I do have a concern though, the ingredients state 100% organic everything.  However, it does not state 100% organic on the tin, nor does the tin have the USDA organic stamp.  Can anyone verfiy this?"
0,"I am aware that tea bags do not give the same flavour as looseleaf, but this stuff is still quite good, and unlike with looseleaf, I can carry a ziplock of teabags with me everywhere so I can  always have tea. These bags are pretty cheap too. I bought one and then split the box among 2 friends, so we each paid like 6 bucks for 40 tea bags. I had never tried Lady Gray before, but it is pretty good. The other three are all classics, and I love them too!"
3,"I have searched for hot chocolate for my Keurig, but couldn't find any that were economical to purchase. I found this at a decent price, and was I glad!  My husband absolutely loves this hot chocolate and says it reminds him of his childhood. Try it - you'll like it!"
0,"I first tried this tea at my Naturopathic Doctor's office waiting area.  It was soooo good!  I looked for it at our local supermarket chains but they only had the Egyptian Licorice herbal tea (minus the mint).  While that one is good, this one is my ""Favorite"".  I introduced it to my son and his wife and they also loved the taste.  Amazon's prices and service can't be beat.  Whenever I am looking for a product, I always check with Amazon first."
0,"When I ordered this tea, I was so excited because I thought I had finally found the equal to another brand's rose tea (in individual bags). I was excited for the loose quality of the tea, along with the anticipated light delicate taste I'd hoped for.<br />I was sadly mistaken... When I excitedly opened it, I was hit by a very sweet, syrupy, cotton-candy-like smell coming from the bag. Not a good scent. Then, I thought 'the smell doesn't determine the taste' so I steeped the recommended tablespoons for the amount of time indicated and then tried a taste. The overpowering sweet smell gave was to a bitter taste, not at all reminiscent of my previous experience with rose tea. Unfortunately, I had to pour the rest of mine out.<br />I have a bag of Hibiscus tea coming in the mail soon from this company. I'm really hoping it's better!"
3,"When it came to hot chocolate my beverage used to be swiss miss.  But after one cold morning of moving a hot tub I was rewarded with Abuelita.  This hot cocoa has tastes of cinnamon and other spices.  I like to add a bit of cayenne or chili powder to it, and it is just delicious."
0,I love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste.  It's equally good as an iced tea.  Full marks!
2,This is a perfect portion and very simple to use when going out. I love the convenience of this product!
3,this item has an awesome chocolate flavor. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for hot chocolate for their keurig or any machine that uses k-cups. Great product
0,"The flavor of the tea is strong and smooth, and a flavor that you would expect in a good English Breakfast Tea.  My only complaint is that the tea is ground very finely, and the tea caddy doesn't keep tea particles from getting into the tea, and some are fine enough to even pass through a tight strainer.<br /><br />The Assam of London loose tea that Amazon carries is much better."
0,"This loose tea is hard to find in stores, I had to order it online and discovered it's a better tea than I usually get with an added bonus of being less expensive so I'm very pleased. I use it only for iced tea, so can't say how it is when hot. It's a stronger tea so I use less. I hope you continue to carry it because I plan on buying more in the future."
3,"Everything about the order went great, the Hot Chocolate is very good. I will be ordering this again probaly soon."
1,"This product is absolutely not to my taste.  It is advertised as a carbonated juice drink, so I kinda expected something along the lines of Welch's Sparkling Grape Juice; I was wrong. The first thing I noticed after opening the can was the aroma; it was unpleasant.  The drink is not very strongly carbonated and there isn't much bite to it.  The strawberry/kiwi flavor is very muted and is masked by something terrible.  The taste was bad going down but worse after a minute or so, as the aftertaste is strong and unpleasant.<br /><br />On top of the bad taste and unpleasant aroma, the drink has a considerable amount of calories for a small can at 135 calories per 8.3 ounces.  Perhaps there are vitamins and things in the drink that make it worthwhile for people who... well, I am not sure who might like this stuff.<br /><br />1/5 - not recommended<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, but I just don't like it."
0,"This variety pack was my ""nice to meet you"" handshake with Twinings teas. It was about time that I tried the brand! I cannot in good conscience say anything about the English Breakfast or Irish Breakfast, as I'm not a big fan of black tea, let alone STRONG black tea as these. But I made a lovely discovery: the Lady Grey. I wrote a review about it saying how it quickly became my favorite comfort tea. As for the Earl Grey, it's passable when I'm out of Lady Grey, but only if I steep it for a few short seconds - otherwise it's too strong.<br /><br />Whatever is the case, here you have the chance to try 4 flavors and find your favorite. Being a 6-pack, you won't have too much of any one tea, which is a good thing.<br /><br />And now I definitely want to try more Twinings flavors."
1,"IF, I repeat IF you are just looking for an all fruit carbonated replacement for soda.....this would fit the bill to a ""T""!<br /><br />We split the can (from Vine) 4 ways , so this is a ""family"" review.<br />My boys, ages 10-16 all liked it, I myself ALWAYS cut soda/fruit drinks w/ a bit of water or soda water, & liked this one just fine following my usual diluting!  Many people remark regarding the calories, but they are no different from any other 100% fruit juice & better for you than soda! Yes it is a bit pricey but it seems to be about average in comparison to similar beverages sold in individual portions..............you are paying for CONVENIENCE!  IF you want to save money just but a fruit concentrate & seltzer/soda water & mix up your own blend (like we do!) I did not have any on hand but a splash of fresh lemon or lime wedge would be Delish with this drink! We sampled it ice cold, don't know if that makes a difference, but if I was offered this again I would definitely grab it up! YUM"
1,"This product claims to be a healthy carbonated product. This particular flavor is very heavy on the orange taste (which is to be expected). As a matter of fact, I found it very close to normal orange soda.<br /><br />Here are the claims of the product from the label:<br /><br />100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All Natural, Carbonated, Great Taste and Refreshment.<br /><br />No Sugar Added, No Corn Syrup, No Preservatives, No Artificial Colors, Gluten Free<br /><br />Nutritional Information:<br /><br />Serving Size 8.3 Fl. Oz. (245 ml)<br />Servings: 1<br /><br />Calories: 140<br />Fat: 0g<br />Sodium: 15 mg<br />Total Carb: 36g (Sugar 34g)<br />Protein: 0g<br /><br />Vitamin C: 100% RDA<br />Vitamin A: 20%<br /><br />Ingredients:  100% Juice (filtered spring water sufficient to reconstitute concentrates, apple grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates), gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Contains Soy.<br /><br />Compared to soda, it is healthier in that it doesn't contain added sugars or corn syrup.  But it still has a bunch of calories.  Eating fruits whole is better than juice, but if you want a quick soda-like pick me up (and you love orange soda), I would recommend this product over regular soda.<br /><br />I gave this product 3 stars because I don't think it really is that healthy, but is a decent alternative to regular soda. Also, the taste was ok, nothing remarkable."
4,"I gave it 3 stars because of the quality ingredients. But if neither of my cats will eat it, what's the use? We tried weaning them to this food from the junk we've been feeding them by mixing and slowly increasing the amount of Felidae, or by getting them real hungry first, all to no avail. The only way they'll eat it is if we cover it with drippings from fish we cook for ourselves, or from cans of sardines.<br /><br />More than anything, I think the mushy pate type texture bothers them more that the taste, because it smells pretty good to me."
1,"It's basically carbonated fruit juice, but it's heavier on the juice than a similar drink like RW Knudsen's (the latter seems to never hit the spot). This drink is a great balance of fresh fruit taste, the right amount of bubbles and something like ""zing"". Very refreshing and tasty.<br /><br />Highly Recommended."
0,"I drink a lot of Earl Grey tea and have tried four or five brands over the years, Bigelow being my favorite.  I've been trying this organic Rishi tea for two weeks now and have experimented with different amounts of tea to get the flavor right and have not been able to. It is just okay for me. This tea is advertised as a bold tea and I see that many reviewers agree but I do not.  If I add too much tea to try to make it stronger it adversely affects the taste unlike other loose teas I use.  Also, this tea requires 1 TBL of dry tea per 8oz of water; I need to use twice that amount for it not to be weak, whereas other loose teas I use only require 1 1/2 tsp. for the same strength, so this Rishi tea would be much more expensive to use regularly.  I may prepare it occasionally just to have a change once in awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful.  It is packed in a very nice earthy looking tin and is slender and tall so fits in the cabinet nicely.  The big plus with this tea is that it's organic."
2,"Granted, we haven't tried all of the other brands of organic baby foods, but this is certainly a GREAT product, especially for baby's first intro to solids. Each one smells & tastes amazingly fresh & good. Packets can be packed in the diaper bag & reconstituted with water or breast milk/formula to the desired consistency. My grandaughter looks like a baby bird with her mouth open waiting for the next bite. That wasn't the case with Earth's ____ brand that she rejected! She loves all of these, especially the squash.  That being said- this isn't inexpensive, so this subscribe & save plan for the variety pack is appreciated. Without that option, we might be searching for another brand- though I'm doubting we would find a better product. Waiting for the expanded 6 pack to be offerred that adds carrots & bananas."
3,"I bought this mostly based on the reviews. I really wanted hot chocolate from Stephen's, but amazon didn't have it. I stumbled across this and thought I would try it. It is white, even though ""cocoa"" is in the title...in case you didn't figure that out! I did realize it wasn't chocolate, but didn't really know what to expect.<br /><br />The best way I can describe it is that it tastes like a vanilla milkshake, but hot! I happen to love vanilla milkshakes way more than chocolate ones (but hate drinking milk, go figure), but somehow, I haven gotten used to this product after about a week. I have 6 cans now, so I have many more opportunities to try! It may just be that I sort of mentally ""expect"" hot chocolate and I have to retrain my slow brain! It is interesting and different, and I still drink it, and almost like it, but still would pick pick the hot chocolate over this. Definitely worth a try if you like vanilla."
1,"Now a days when  you think of Soda most people think of unhealthy, bad for your body, stains your teeth, and the list can go on and on. Not true with the lastest soft drink craze, Switch. This carbonated soft drink beverage is the perfect blend of healthy and fun! Definitely one to try out!"
4,"Cats are finicky animals and what one loves another won't touch - that is not a reflection on the food itself. I have two Burmese and their eating habits are very different. My local Pet Nutrition Center kindly gave me a sample of Prowl the other day and while my one cat absolutely loves it, the other won't touch it. That's why samples are nice. Both of my cats have been on Evo kibble, but this one cat who now loves the Prowl, has a habit of throwing up and I'm on the prowl myself for an alternative food that will help her keep food down. So far, no barf. She also laps it up as soon as I've added warm water - no waiting. I highly recommend you obtain a sample and let the cat decide, as the food is economical as well as healthy."
3,"I don't think there is a better hot cocoa (especially at this price)on the market than Stephen's. It lasted me the entire winter and made for awesome x-mas gifts. Now everyone I know buys it and I'm even happier to be spreading it around. My only issue is that I wish they would have a mixed pack; a 6 pack of mint, hazelnut, regular, dark, vanilla and irish cream would really be perfect!"
3,"I love hot cocoa and hot chocolate... and have tried many different brands.<br /><br />GHIRADELLI is by far the worst that I have ever tasted!  I honestly don't have any idea how they ever became famous for their hot cocoa.<br /><br />This cocoa has an awful, stale taste... and you can tell that it is made of cheap ingredients.<br /><br />It even tastes worse than the much lower-cost brands like Swiss Miss and Nestle.<br /><br />If you want a REAL hot chocolate, look up MARIE BELLE.  It is thick and rich... not weirdly processed garbage like GHIRADELLI!!!"
4,"Excellent quality pet food with no inert ingredients, filler or potentially unhealthy meat by-products. I used to have to travel several zip codes away to buy it, and it was well worth the trip to give them food I was confident was of the highest quality. My cats can't get enough of it and the price is very competitive, especially if you are a Prime member.<br /><br />Still in doubt? Try this test:<br /><br />Open a can of your current cat food and smell it.. then compare that to any flavor of Merrick. It won't turn your stomach.<br /><br />When it says fish, there are huge chunks of -you guessed it- fish. Not a weird extruded-looking grey or stinky brown paste that you could mistake for what comes out the other end, but actual food in a can. Speaking of which, the post meal 'litter box stink' period is dramatically reduced as well, as is fecal volume. Less to clean :)<br /><br />Give it a try.. remember to mix it with your old food for a day to two to ease the transition, but your cats will thank you for it."
0,Was led to believe that this product was individual tea bags not loose tea which requires special brewing equipment and now I'm stuck with product I can't move.  Chef Joseph
3,I love the flavor and the speed of this cocoa I drink one at night and each is the same good stuff.
3,This hot chocolate is very good and flavorful. Compared to other hot chocolate that we have tried it is cheaper and we would recommend.
1,"I did not find this drink special in terms of taste; it is kiwi juice infused with carbonation, and a burst of strawberry. Carbonation makes the juice acidic and produces stronger effect on taste buds than the fruit juice.  It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. I hope other reviewers find this drink a little more interesting.<br /><br />1. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />3. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />4. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C"">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />5. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G"">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />6. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZLCQ"">Vita Coco Coconut Water with Passion Fruit, 11.2-Ounce Containers (Pack of 12)</a><br />7. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>"
3,Kids loved it. Great product at a great price.  My little one can make her own hot cocoa without my assistance.
3,"I was hesitant to try this cocoa after all the horrible reviews about how it tasted so bad, and had a really bad Sucralose flavor. I don't know if I'm just not as picky as others or what it is, but I thought this hot cocoa was really good. Creamy and rich, and almost TOO sweet. I don't think it has an ""aftertaste"" though, how some have described. I used the middle water setting on my Keurig or ""small mug""...7.25 oz., I guess. Everyone has their own tastes and preferences, but as for me, I really like this product!"
2,"Not only are they organic, but they are the perfect snack for little ones! My 17-month old loves these, especially the blueberries which are SOOOOOO good for you---he doesn't like fresh ones, but freeze-dried ones are great!!! We LOVE Little Duck Organics."
0,"Revolution's teas are superb. Smooth and delicate, each one has been pleasant, comforting and a pure delight. I've tried this one, the pomegranate, as well as ginger peach, Dragon Eye Oolong, and white pear."
0,"This tea is more ginger than lemon, so if you like the taste of soothing ginger, you'd like this product. I mix two packages per 16 oz BPA-free Camelbak bottle, filled with 8 oz of water and the rest ice, and a packet of stevia. Shake well, take sip, ahhh - no-calorie sweet tea, green tea antioxidant, and great for summer. I called the Stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet, and the rep said ""negligible.""<br /><br />I also buy the Stash powdered mint green tea, and I prefer the hint of mint better. Again, if you are a ginger fan, you'd really enjoy this product."
0,"This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant. It's much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way, with a lot of water and a bit of milk. This is very creamy and tasty. My only criticism is that there aren't enough sachets in the box. Only 10. Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water (approximately half a cup), it's not enough for a good cup of tea, so I use two. That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea. But it's a delicious after-dinner drink! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box."
1,"well, my husband, myself and my 12 year old son sampled this drink. My husband hated it. I felt like it was OK, but nothing to write home about. The taste to me was too orangey and for a ""natural"" product it sure didn't taste like one. My 12 year old liked it. He also likes gummy worms and sour straws, so you can take his review for what it is.<br /><br />I personally wouldn't buy this product.<br />2 stars"
0,"As soon as I picked up the container, I was sure I would be in for a treat.  It's so well made, not a cheap-feeling tin full of dusty tea.  The excellent quality of this tea was apparent even before filling the teapot: long lustrous leaves with a heavenly aroma.  Use much less tea than the instructions on the package call for: since this tea is very flavorful it does not take much to brew a good cup.  The characteristic Earl Grey flavor is exactly balanced with the strength of the tea flavor.  Recommended without hesitation."
0,I like loose tea and hate having to clean out the metal holders.  These bags are ideal as they let me make a pot or just a cup of tea and then throw it in the compost pile to be reused for my garden.
2,"We had ordered some of these pouches after trying some other Happy Baby products that my baby loved. These had very little flavor and my baby tried a couple bites and then started to fight me. She even gagged in the process. Bummed that I had ordered a whole box, we tried again to no avail. Next, we  tried to feed it to the cat because she seemed interested when I opened the pouches. My cat won't even eat it. I recommend getting a small quantity to see if your baby likes it before ordering a whole box."
1,"The benefit of this drink is that it is ""no sugar added, 100% juice,"" which tastes basically like fruit soda.  I can see it as a good alternative to traditional soda, especially for kids and teens.  However, for adults I think the drink still tastes really sugary, despite the fact that sugar has not been added.  I ran for my toothbrush as soon as I was finished.  However, the taste is good and the kiwi berry was a nice flavor.  For young people with a sweet tooth I would recommend it, but I think grown ups will have a more difficult time jumping on board."
1,"I wasn't sure what to expect from a carbonated fruit drink, but decided to give it a try.  While it was drinkable, I actually prefer the natural taste of fruit juice.  This actually tasted like an artificial soda, much like a very well known orange soda.  The carbonation was excessively strong, with too much bite and burn for my liking.<br /><br />As some other reviewers pointed out, the amount of sugar and calories in this drink was astounding.  It is almost too sweet, and combined with the carbonation was just too much for me to enjoy it very much."
0,"Where I'm located, my choices for loose green tea are practically non-existent.  I had found and tried this Twinings Gunpowder Green (loose) tea at a local Fresh Market.  I enjoyed it, but getting to that store (and their having it in stock) was troublesome.  I was very happy to see the same tea on Amazon for a bit over a dollar LESS (per tin) than my local cost (not including my travel time or tolls paid).  The tea has a very nice flavor (FAR better than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QPU"">Stash Premium Green Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> which was the other green tea I'd found locally).  It also has a good color and aroma.  One of the things I like about gunpowder tea is that it's easy to portion out.  I scoop out 1 level teaspoon of tea and use it for two full serving in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NR7C0"">Bodum YoYo Personal Tea Set with Infuser and 12-Ounce Glass</a>.  The tea leaves are of sufficient quality that there are almost no fragments, so nothing gets through the infuser but the flavor.  If I were a tea purist, I'd probably have some issue with the fact that the gunpowder rolls of leaves are not as tight as they should be and the spent leaves look like they're somewhat irregular.  But, considering that this tea is many times less expensive than the high quality stuff from the specialty shops, I'm very happy with it.  The one thing I'm just a touch worried about is storage.  The six tins in this package will last me many months.  Since each tin is opaque and is sealed with an aluminum film, I figured the best location for storing the tea until I moved it to my ""in-use"" spot would be the refrigerator.  The tin and the film should keep light and moisture out and the temperature fluctuations should be minimal.  But, I still worry a bit.  Still, I'm very pleased with the tea and rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5."
1,"The kiwi/berry combination makes this sweet and tart at the same time, with the carbonation adding a nice bit of fizz to keep the concoction light. That being said, this was a bit too sweet for my taste - but may be fine for people looking for the 100% juice experience, or those needing a sugar fix after a workout. Personally I'd mix this with sparkling soda water for a ""less is more"" effect, with cost savings as an added plus."
4,This product is really a hit or miss. My cat does not seem to go crazy over these treats....Sometimes he does not eat these right away.
1,I really like the flavor of this one! It has a low acidity but still full of flavor! Now I have to have it every morning and I am having trouble finding another one I like this much.
0,"I was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it. Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.  As a tonic for health and energy, I now find myself drinking it daily instead of my usual afternoon coffee. It perks up the body and brain without the jittery effects of caffeine. I find I get a delightful pick-me-up later in the day--when I need it--without the negative affects of keeping me up at night.  While a tad expensive, I will continue to buy SPORtea and enjoy its delicious brew.  It is now a part of my every day routine."
2,"Blah!  My baby didn't like it, then I tasted it and it was awful.  It is NOTHING like what you might expect.  It's like bland goop with a faint hint of unseasoned over-boiled chicken.  What, is the theory that we should give our babies nasty food simply to take advantage of the fact that they have nothing to compare it to?  I didn't even feed it to my dog."
1,"I've never been a fan of kiwi & strawberry together, but I think Switch got it right by combining fruit juice with carbonation.  I am a big fan!  It was a little bit too sweet, but I'm hoping other flavors will tone that done a little.  I suspect that the 135 calories for this perfectly sized can is due to the fruit itself, and not added sugar, although there is acerola in it - which is also known as the Puerto Rican Cherry.  That means no added sugar at all.  Try this - I don't think you'll regret it."
0,"I watched a YouTube video on guayusa tea, and heard very good things about it there and on the amazon reviews as welll so I thought I would give it a try. Money well spent! This tea is smooth and easy to drink, and is absolutely delicious with sugar and honey.<br />Another awesome thing about this tea is the dreams you get. My mother hasn't had a lucid dream in years, and I offered this tea to her one day, and that night she had three vivid lucid dreams! She was so thrilled she bought two more boxes of the Runa guayusa tea. I am so satisfied with this product, and would definitely recommend to anyone who needs some steady energy, focus, and vivid dreams. :)"
1,"I LOVE these! I don't drink soda anymore because I'm trying to be healthier, so when I'm craving a coke I grab these. Perfect coke taste, with a lot less calories and sugar!"
4,"I just got this and so far my finicky cat loves it!<br />One of my friends recommended I try this for my cat as she has allergies<br />that we think are food allergies and so far nothing else has helped.<br />Friend's cat no longer has allergies on this food and I hope the same for mine; only time will tell.<br /><br />Addendum:  She still loves it but for $20 plus in shipping which it now is, I'll be switching to something else."
0,"I have been looking for a nice strong rose tea, and this is the one!  I've tried a number of brands, but they weren't ""rosy"" enough for me.  This is an excellent tea with a strong rose flavor.  No bitterness - nice and smooth.  I highly recommend this tea!"
0,"I love Earl Grey Tea, but I can't always drink caffeinted tea. This really fits the bill. Same great flavor, but it doesn't keep me up all night. Nice addition to the K-cup selection. I used to purchase a similar item from Green Mountain Coffee, but they eliminated the product. So I really appreciate the ability to buy this from Amazon."
2,I have tried this flavor first time when my son was 6 months and he loved it right away. Did not have problem with texture either. This one and Chick Chick are his favorite right now.
1,"This stuff is surprisingly good. A lightly carbonated fruit drink, it's got a tangy-sweet flavor that's really unique. The cans themselves are awfully small, but the taste is truly big. It's made from 100% juice with no added sugar, corn syrup, or artifical sweeteners, yet plenty sweet enough naturally for most people's taste I'd think. My 12-year-old son loves it too. A terrific, natural drink. Ingredients include apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, rasberry, and strawberry juice concentrates reconstitued with filtered, sparkling water. It's all natural though they have added vitamin C so that it provides 100% RDA. A most excellent drink I'll continue buying for a very long time."
0,"Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the ""green pearl"" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream."
0,"The taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of Yunnan. It is ok to drink, but not to really enjoy. I only make it for when I am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway."
1,this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on 8oz setting however its not the best I've ever tasted nor the worst. its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you don't. I my self happen to like it and will buy again unless I find something better.
0,This tea is a new flavor of black tea by Tazo. It's better than some other brands but not even close to beIng as good as their old flavor of black tea with citrus (which they took off the market). I don't think this tea is worth sending away for because you can buy it locally in most grocery stores.
4,"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters."
1,"Described as an alternative to soda, Switch is a carbonated fruit drink made from 100% natural juices (although not necessarily the ones listed as the flavor).  Made mostly out of apple and grape juice, The Switch Orange Tangerine does in fact have an (oversweet)orange-tangerine flavor -- followed by a strong vitamin aftertaste. It tasted like drinking a soda made from crushed Flintstone vitamins.<br /><br />Want a better carbonated fruit drink?  Pour half a glass of orange juice and add club soda."
0,"We have been using this product for many years of enjoyment.  In summer, my wife uses it for iced tea almost every evening for our supper.  There is some usually left over so it can be used either hot or cold at a later time, even early the following day.  We read that tea is good for the body too."
1,"We all liked the Switch Kiwi Berry.  The first sip was a bit too sweet for me, but the children loved it.  My son wanted more, but we only had the one can to try.  I love the fact, that it is sugar free and natural flavors. The children loved it straight up, I had to put some ice in mine to dilute it a bit.  This is definitely a great tasting substitute for children and adults, that like the sparkling flavored sodas.  It actually tastes like strawberries, could not taste the kiwi part. We'll have to try the other flavors."
1,"After taking my first sip of Switch Orange/Tangerine, I raised a suspicious eyebrow because it didn't taste the way I expected it to. Then it dawned on me that my mouth was prepared for more of a fake, amped-up ""Orange"" soda, but what I was tasting was real, natural juice. Yes, I knew that from the label, but that's not the same as experiencing it.<br /><br />The taste was a nice blend of orange and tangerine, not too sweet, and the carbonation adds a nice touch. A bit like a non-alcoholic Mimosa cocktail.<br /><br />My only reservation is that the calorie count is (perhaps unavoidably) too high for me to drink this on a regular basis - though let me be quick to point out that this is a ""no sugar added"" product. For those who aren't counting calories, a nice refreshing ""Switch"" from soft drinks!"
2,"I have just found out today that the gelatin in this product is coming from pork. I do not know why they would add gelatin in the first place. DHA from fish oil is fine, but the lady who answered my phone told me that all DHA Gerber baby food items have pork gelatin. Do infants need gelatin at this age?"
0,"Yogi Tea has introduced a winner in Egyptian Licorice Mint.  It's the perfect after dinner herbal tea.  It doesn't have a strong licorice or mint flavor, but instead a delightful synthesis.  I feel like it's easy on my tummy and doesn't need food to complement it.  What more could you ask for?"
2,I always try the food before I feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good. My daughter LOVES it. She gets all excited when I make it for her
2,"For whatever reason, our son really likes this flavor. I'm not a fan myself, but I'm not the one eating it. Any time I can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting, I'm a happy mom."
1,"This is a good drink, tastes like soda, but fruity.  I really liked it, nice alternative to soda."
3,So chocolaty and spiced just right! I decided to try this brand after reading all the wonderful reviews. I'd never had spiced hot chocolate before - just the plain store-bought instant kind. WOW! The flavor of this just blew me away! Best cup of hot chocolate I've ever tasted!! I'm hooked!!
0,"Not only was this tea a good bargain, and good tea.<br /><br />But because it's sold in bulk, in recyclable metal containers, it has a much smaller environmental/manufacturing footprint than tea sold in tea bags.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />It also makes a great gift for the tea lovers in your life."
0,I love this brand of Dandelion Root tea.  The tea is so good for your health and keeps you regular.  Transaction went smooth like always.  So glad to hear Amazon may soon have home delivery of groceries to my door.  I have some disabilities that require someone to shop for me but I do a lot of it on Amazon.com
3,"I bought this from safeway for about $5. It's awesome in making those homemade iced caramel macchiatos that cost $4 at starbucks! :)<br /><br />(I don't know if it's just me, but it has this slight chocolatey aftertaste to it that's just absolutely divine)"
1,"Light and refreshing.  But if you are looking for an alternative to soda,  sorry, but this is pretty much soda. I appreciate the fact that it is 100% natural, and has a full complement of Vitamin C. And I actually like the fact that it isn't too sweet, nor too tart. No added sugar, but plenty of ""fruit sugars"". In the end, though . . it's a soda. My 6-year old loved it."
0,Great tasting tea and very healthy.  I was very surprised and will probably be ordering more.  It does cost - but the cheapest I have found.
0,"As a tea junky, the quality of the product and the shipping/handling were great. I enjoy the tea and would buy more from them for sure."
0,"Well, where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have been drinking tea (green, black, oolong, white, etc.) for more than 15 years as either loose leaf (whole leaf) or bagged. My number one love is green tea ... specifically Japanese Sencha. I have consumed many grades and types of steaming (mild, medium and ""deep""). I have also tried many of the products offered by ""Two Leaves and a Bud"" by way of Whole Foods (who do not offer this).<br /><br />This is the first offering by Two Leaves that I sadly have to say is dreadful. Before you think I'm a jerk, let me say that they offer some awesome bagged teas. This just isn't one of them (IMHO).<br /><br />The orange that they add KILLS all of the beauty that the Sencha could potentially offer. What's worse is they suggest a steeping time of 4-minutes. Ludicrous. Most mild steamed (which this is) or medium steamed Sencha's steep for no more than 3-minutes. Four minutes will produce an acrid bitter brew unless the Sencha is a superior grade (which this doesn't appear to be).<br /><br />Even after steeping this for about 3 minutes, the taste is still overwhelmingly sharp & ""bitty"" (just a weaker sharp). I can not believe that the people at Two Leaves have ever had a good cup of loose leaf Sencha. I can't. If they have, they wouldn't offer this.<br /><br />I can only assume they add so much orange to it because the Sencha grade is poor. Otherwise, why not sell it without the orange flavor like the wonderful <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGZKWM"">Two Leaves and a Bud, Tamayokucha Extremely Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100 Count</a> they offer? The Tamayokucha is excellent! No orange flavor needed, and I bet none is needed here either.<br /><br />Bummer is that I was dumb enough to buy the 100 count box (my bad). There is no way I can drink the rest of it and I would feel horrible if I gave it away to someone. They would think I had no taste in teas.<br /><br />My advice: buy a single box of this first. If you like it, switch to coffee."
2,This used to be a hearty and great meal for my twin girls who have both loved it since they were 9 months old but they recently changed the recipe and it is watery and disgusting now. Very disappointed. And it seems that amazon does not allow you to complain directly to Happy Baby or return the product even though it has changed. seems unfair.
1,"Upon first glance, one would think this is your regular energy drink. The size of the product does seem to convey this. At 8.3 oz, this is something a lot of people could finish in one or two gulps.<br /><br />The flavor is nice and tasty. You can taste both the berry and kiwi.  No funny aftertaste and it goes down easily.  It is not tart nor is it too sweet. The carbonation isn't too overpowering. It's not as strong as a soda but it's not on it's last fizzy breath either.  I could see the bubbles disappearing faster than soda after sitting out for a while.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this is a nice alternative to your average soda/juice box.  It'd be perfect for kids to drink in school.  My only suggestion is to make the can a little bigger as there's just not enough juice to completely quench your thirst for the price that you are paying."
4,my cat absolutely loves these treats & they were first givin to mr by my vet who is also a friend. musc less expensive with amazon
1,"I ordered this product after enjoying a previous Vine acquisition--<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094JEUO"">Izze Sparkling Clementine Soda Full Case (24 12oz Bottles)</a>--fully expecting to like it.  It appears that the use of 100% juice in this product makes a big difference from the Izze's use of 70% juice/30% sparkling water.  I like Izze, but do not like Switch much.<br /><br />Switch tastes -- and is -- just like orange juice, except it is carbonated.  I do not think orange juice was meant to be carbonated.  It just doesn't add anything to the taste or consistency that I found enjoyable.  It also left a lengthy aftertaste of juice burps which I did not enjoy.  So it is not that the makes have done anything wrong or poor quality, it is just that this reviewer did not like how the concept worked out."
3,"I like my hot chocolate to have alot of ""chocolatey"" flavor. Even when I use the smallest size brewing cup the Green Mountain hot cocoa K-cups tastes watered down. I have to add my own powdered hot chocolate to give it enough flavor."
0,"I first tasted this at Petrossian.  I had ordered Green Tea and when I tasted it, I was a little shocked that it was not regular green tea.  I noticed the citron immediately and it was fantastic.  It complimented the tea very well.  The tea is very light.  Au Bon Pain also carries this tea.  Try it out!"
2,"My baby has been eating this brand since he was 6 months. I like the convenience of high quality/yet not overly pricey jar food like this. It is easy on his stomach. Never had any health issues with it. The ""dinners"" are a bit more filling than the usual watery vegetable puree but it still does need a little cereal to thicken up. Summer vegetable is his least favorite. The zucchini (like cucumber) smells pretty strong. He would eat it now but when we first started, he hated it. My son loves the other 3 flavors and that's why I continued with my subscription since it's more expensive to buy them separately."
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry is an excellent product that far exceeded my expectations.  I'm not a fan of the kiwi-strawberry combo that when attempted with artificial flavors comes of as borderline toxic, but The Switch succeeds where others fail, and without the need for artificial flavors or unnecessary additives.<br />I  had my doubts about this product, primarily because there are so many new ""craft"" sodas on the market.  These ""craft"" sodas seem to be the  non-alcoholic equivalent of the micro-brew craze that seems to be leveling off.<br />The fact that the product is actually fruit juice, gives me high-hopes that the corn syrup and chemically dependant soda industry can innovate with solid and natural products.<br />The small size is also a benefit, in that it's adequate for this type of beverage.  We've become a society of excess, and sodas, colas and other soft-drinks have not been immune,  The Switch brings us back to the days of reasonable and healthy serving sizes and hopefully consumers will take note.<br />An all-around excellent product that I will be looking for in stores."
1,"These gave me a headache, too much sugar, and other ingredients that didn't sit well.  I would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier."
1,"If giving your kids, or yourself, carbonated juice gets them (or you) to drink more juice and less soda, that's good.  But the taste of this is similar to the juice in juice boxes.  It's a blend of juices with a fruit punch type of flavor.  It's also quite pricey.  Interesting once, but I won't be buying more."
0,"This is a good tea, for an incredible price.  However, unless you drink tea on a daily basis, it is probably not what you're looking for.  It comes in a very large quantity that will not stay fresh forever.<br /><br />That said, I brew kombucha in five gallon batches.  This tea makes an excellent kombucha, and I use it quickly enough to justify the quantity."
0,"Just in case, if anyone doesn't know what WHITE tea is, as opposed to green or black, let's quote Wikipedia: ""white tea is fast-dried, while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan (while kept moving for even curing). Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing."" What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.<br /><br />This particular product, while it comes in tea bags, it's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety. Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder.<br /><br />This being a white tea, 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet, green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If it's not 'love at the first sip', give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />- organic, fair trade certified White Tea<br />- natural Lychee flavor<br />- organic Osmanthus flavor<br />- contains caffeine<br /><br />The somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer. Time will tell but at this time 3 stars (meaning 'it's Okay') seem to be the fair rating."
1,"The Switch tries to blur the line between soda and juice, and I'd say that the experiment is successful. It's sweet and rich like soda, but it is, as the label says, 100% juice, and therefore of vastly more nutritional value. I guess it all comes down to taste, and it's more similar to soda than juice here, maybe like a more toned-down Sunkist soda. As I said, I liked it, and I'd probably pick it up again, though it hasn't displaced Squirt as my favorite."
1,"Ingredient list: Sugar, Acidity Regulator (including miscellaneous chemicals). No tea whatsoever. $22 for 18 oz. (500g) of sugar with apple flavor. Most expensive sugar in the market!! Health benefit? None! It comes in a square tin with plastic bag inside containing granulated sugar. That's all. Nothing more."
2,My kids love these and I feel good about giving them to them. They're all natural and sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar. We like to pop them in the microwave for about 10 seconds - then they taste like fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies. Yum.
1,"Our family, wife, 2 year old and 4 year old, have had other Switch sodas in the past, and liked them quite a bit. They had a bit  of an apple flavor overrode the main That's definitely not true for the Orange & Tangerine. It tastes almost like fresh squeezed orange juice with bubbles. Far better than Orangina or orange soda.<br /><br />My kids kept asking for more sips of the soda throughout dinner, and we all have enjoyed it. I appreciate that there's no caffeine, and it's all natural, so I have no problem giving it to my kids. I'd definitely recommend buying the soda, we'll keep some around the house regularly."
4,"My youngest cat goes insane over this stuff!  (Which is good -- she's the reason we had to seek out a new food that was for both adults and kittens.)  My older cat took a few weeks to adapt to the creamier texture, compared to her ""favorite"" canned food, although she loved the taste right away.  Once she got used to it, we started going through this case like it was going out of style and I had to buy more!  I have noticed much less smelly litter boxes since we got into this case, compared to many of the foods we use ... that was a big bonus for me, and enough to convince me to put this into our regular rotation of canned foods."
0,"For those of you wanting a high-quality, yet affordable green tea, you should definitely give this one a try. Let me first start by saying that everyone is looking for something different for their ideal tea, and I will attempt to briefly highlight what makes this tea attractive to a wide range of tea drinkers (whether you are a beginner or long-time tea enthusiast).  I have gone through over 12 boxes of this tea myself, and highly recommend it for the following reasons:<br /><br />-Quality:  First, this tea offers a smooth quality without any harsh or bitter after tones, which often turns people off from many green teas.  I've found my ideal brewing time to be between 3-5 minutes, giving you a light but flavorful cup of tea.  However, if you get distracted or forget about your tea and leave it brewing for 20+ minutes like I sometimes do, the quality of this tea is such that you still get a smooth but deeper flavor without the bad after taste.  The leaves themselves are whole leaves (not powdered stems, branches, etc commonly found in other brands), and the high-quality nylon bags also include chunks of tropical fruit and other discernible ingredients.  This isn't your standard cheap paper bag with a mix of unknown ingredients that have been ground down to a fine powder, leaving you to wonder what it is you are actually drinking.<br /><br />-Taste:  This tea offers notes of real pineapple and other hints of tropical fruits, yet isn't sweet or artificially flavored.  You have the foundation of a high-quality young hyson green tea for those true ""tea flavor"" lovers, yet the subtle hints of fruit make this a truly unique tea that I believe most will enjoy.  If you want it sweet, you can add sugar, splenda, etc but this really is not necessary as this tea offers an inherent warmth of flavor through it's ingredients.<br /><br />-Price:  This tea offers an excellent product at an exceptional price (especially when purchased at the prices Amazon offers).  Compared to other brands which I believe to be of similar quality (Mighty Leaf, Rishi, Two Leaves, etc.), Revolution offers a superior product at an outstanding price.  I have been purchasing this through Amazon for less per box than I would be paying at my local grocery store for Lipton, etc.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful tea that is comparable, and even better than, other teas that are priced much higher.  It offers a well-balanced cup of green tea that I believe many will enjoy.  In terms of taste, quality, and price, I would argue you won't find a better combination that that offered by Revolution's Tropical Green Tea."
4,"Although a little pricey, these are a great way to give your cat a healthy treat. My cat has a sensitive stomach and cant always eat the treats I have gotten for him without him throwing up. I stopped using grocery store treats and moved to Natural Balance but they were too much for his tummy, but these treats he absolutley loves and he never gets sick afterwards. Also, with the all natural ingredients I feel good about rewarding him.<br />(p.s. since they are natural ingredients they are stinky like salmon.)"
3,I've tried ever single brand of K-cup hot chocolate and this is absolutely the best one. It is the only one that actually tastes like the real stuff.
4,"My cats both LOVE this food.  I've had varying success with about 7 different kinds of canned food.  This one is a hit with both.  It's natural, mostly organic, doesn't have any junk or fillers, and I have peace of mind knowing that we're giving them high quality food from an ethical company.  Since they've been on this diet they are more active, alert and happy.  Their coats are so soft and shiny and they seem to be shedding less.  Cannot say how relieved I am to have finally found a food they like that is so good for them as well.  It is pricey but if you want to save on costly vet bills down the road due to illness caused by poor nutrition, this is the way to go."
1,"I like to try new things and we have a British store nearby call the Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. The other day when I was there I picked up a liter bottle of Robinson's Apple and Blackcurrant Fruit Drink imported from England. It's a concentrate and has no added sugar. You use one part of the concentrated drink with four parts of water. For the water, I choose an ice-cold slightly carbonated spring  water. Just mix and, viola, a nice tasting glass of fruit drink with a minimum of calories. Delicious! Very, very good. And the original bottle says it has 22 servings, although I may make up a little larger serving than they suggest. Well, what can I say? It tastes like a very good soda pop and has an absolute minimum of calories.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
2,"I was very hesitant to try this food for my 7 month old. After mixing up the sweet potatoes (with water) I tried them, and they were awful! I added more water and decided that it must be the fact that they were dried that's making them so terrible. I gave them to my son and later that day he threw them all up. My son has not thrown up once since begin born.... this food is terrible. Once the water is added, it doesn't smell right, much less taste right.... Please just stick regular organic baby food."
1,"I enjoyed the taste... It is close to orange soda initially but then there is another sweet taste at the end of each sip.  But unlike orange soda, this is healthier and no added sugars.  Even though this product tastes like orange soda I think it would do well for breakfast.  It may even become preferred over traditional orange juice for children and for businesses that worry about short shelf life.  On the downside, the price is a little high for such a small can when buying 24."
1,Refreshing and light.  A little on the sweet side but not overly sweet.  I enjoyed the orange flavor!
0,"I am so happy I found this tea on Amazon, I have been looking in stores for over a year.<br />It shipped immediately and I was so happy to have it in my kitchen again."
1,"My experience with soft drinks has been mostly limited to the major brands so this was quite a change---these sodas have a much cleaner( less chemical)and therefore more refreshing taste than the Coke/7up/Canada Dry variety.  The cane sugar and glass bottles seem to make all the difference( although I still prefer Canada Dry to Boylan's Ginger Ale).<br />$3.25 per 12 oz. bottle is a bit steep. I would check your local specialty markets to see if they carry this; unfortunately, the nearby Trader Joes dropped this product so I'll have to check Gelson's or Whole Foods."
1,"My kids and I love root beer and I brew my own from time to time. Recently while purchasing some specialty versions from a local store I saw the Jack Blacks Red Dead Root Beer and thought the label was cool so I grabbed a couple. After we sampled it, all I can say is don't waste your time. It has little to no root beer flavor,it finishes a little spicy in fact. It has caffine added which was a bit of a put off as well. I was very disappointed with the flavor of this product. If you want a pick me up and you don't mind it tasting like sugar water mixed with dish soap then this is the drink for you."
1,"I'm sitting here, (Switch) drink in hand, trying to decide how to describe the Switch Kiwi Berry. It's lightly carbonated, which I like but too sweet for my taste (think strawberry candy). The mouth feel is quite round and it has some body too it. It's made from juice concentrates and carbonated water and there are 135 calories of sugar in the small 8 oz can. I wouldn't call it a healthy beverage and whether it's natural or not doesn't matter to me."
1,"In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself. But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water? Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good! Frankly, I found Black Cherry, Kiwi Berry, and Watermelon Strawberry pretty similar in taste, Orange Tangerine more distinctly tart, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 other flavor choices: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C"">The Switch Fruit Punch, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG943G"">The Switch Grape, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used. Fruit Punch, Orange Tangerine, and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest calories, 140; Kiwi Berry is next, 135; Black Cherry is next, 130; and Grape has the lowest, 125.  Orange Tangerine and Watermelon Strawberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 36g; Black Cherry and Fruit Punch are next, 35g; Kiwi Berry is next, 34g; and Grape has the lowest, 33g. Finally Watermelon Strawberry has the highest sugars, 35g; Fruit Punch and Orange Tangerine are next, 34g; Black Cherry and Kiwi Berry are next, 33g, and Grape is the lowest, 32g.<br /><br />Note: all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice. All contain acerola, apple, and grape juice. In addition to their title juices Kiwi Berry contains raspberry and strawberry, and Fruit Punch contains cherry, lemon, and pineapple.  Orange Tangerine also contains soy.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK"">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  The difference? The Izze products are fortified with vitamins: B6 and Niacin in addition to C and have roughly three fifths the calories, total carbohydrates, and sugars of The Switch products."
1,This is for sure not what I was expecting it to taste like. It's not bad but not for me. I like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar. When I first took a sip of it I noticed it has a bite to it. The best way I can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne. I however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me.
4,"The box stores have begun to drop inventory items and this variety is not available at Albertsons, Safeway and QFC here in NW.<br />Our cat needs this for an RX for stomach problems.<br />We were able to find it on Amazon in quantity and at a discount.<br />Delivery was fantastic and the cat is in heaven as she knows she has a three month supply in the cupboard."
0,"Dynasty brand green tea is the best green tea I've ever tasted.  It never tastes stale, unlike brands I've bought in grocery stores.  This is because each tea bag is packed in a sealed envelope with a metallic lining.  The metal apparently keeps out moisture."
4,"Well, I had high hopes for these treats, which are small, and smell terrible. They are semi-moist treats. Other than the smell, they seem like a fine product, just not for my boy Wesley. He was totally uninterested. He sniffed it once, and that was it. He wouldn't even chase it when it rolled across the room. (A clear poor sign.) So, although the resealable packaging is great, and the cat depicted on the bag is cute, this won't be a winner in our household. Perhaps a different flavor would be better.<br /><br />One thing to note, Wesley has not had semi-moist treats before, so that could be it as well. Hopefully your cat will have happier results!"
0,BURNED OUT ON COFFEE THIS TEA FILLS THE VOID PERFECTLY FOR ME.I DEFINITELT WILL PURCHASE MORE TEA IN FUTURE .TWININGS MAKES GREAT TEA.
1,"It's exactly what it claims to be: carbonated juice. Imagine mixing 2 parts snapple with 1 part seltzer. It's a lot like that, but simpler.<br /><br />The flavor is definitely juicy, not sugary like soda. But, it's not very complex. Think juice box. Kiwi is the primary flavor. I can hardly taste any strawberry. It tasted more like grape and maybe a hint raspberry.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent alternative to soda. It's a bit on the pricey side at nearly a dollar for a 8.3 oz can. The only non-natural ingredient is ascorbic acid AKA Vitamin C as a preservative. In fact, I would recommend they add a little more Vitamin C to give it more tart. As is, it contains 100% DV of Vitamin C.<br /><br />I'd say its worth buying. Its a refreshing drink that doesn't leave you feeling guilty or crashing from a sugar high later. Just don't get in the habit of expecting the flavor as labeled."
0,"My sister is the real tea drinker in the family, I lean more toward coffee. But I was attracted to the idea of this tea: a Fair Trade product, totally organic, described as ""bold and sweetly smooth,"" and I wanted to give it a try. Once I had opened the lid (double lid, actually) on the neat looking can and saw the incredibly dark and aromatic leaves, I knew I wanted this all to myself. True to its promise this Earl Grey tea is delicious. A strong tea, a smooth tea, no bitterness (my usual complaint about tea in general), and really does not need the addition of lemon, milk or sweetener - as a matter of fact, I think that would hide some of the more nuanced flavors I tasted here. I will definitely keep a can of this on hand for myself..... and I may even buy one for my sister."
0,"I ordered three different kinds of Yogi tea based on the great reviews -- lemon ginger, stomach ease, and green tea super antioxident. Unfortunately, they all taste exactly the same -- like licorice. If you like licorice flavor, you'll like this tea. If you're looking for something that actually tastes like lemon and ginger, look elsewhere."
1,"When I first glanced at this item, my first thought was a Nehi orange-type soft drink.  However, it is made of 100% fruit juice with carbonation added.  It tastes way too sweet for my taste buds, much more than regular OJ.  In fact, it left an aftertaste in my mouth and I had to brush my teeth right after taste-testing it.<br /><br />I ended up mixing the rest with a shot of vodka and it made a great screwdriver with a kick of carbonation."
2,"I tasted these apples at a store with my 3-yr old daughter, and we both really liked them.  Most dried apples I've tasted are really soft and thick.  These are a little thinner and crunchier.  And Amazon had the best price I could find.  We will order these again when we run out.  A great snack to have in the car, too."
0,Trader Joe's Pomegranate White tea is superior to this tea. This is very bitter and perfumey. Maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems . I found it repulsive.
0,"Thought I was ordering summer tea flavors, got leftover winter garbage. I will not buy from this seller again. I HATE iced coffee, much less gingerbread and eggnog flavors! I cannot believe I just spent that amount of money on crap that I will not ever drink. Should have waited until Walmart carried it! Does Keurig know this stuff is being sold under such false advertisements? Yes, I know it says flavors may be substituted. That would be fine if they were more teas. If I had wanted gross iced coffee flavors, I would have ordered such!<br /><br />On the up side, the peach tea I received was very good. Otherwise, don't waste your money!"
3,Love this hot chocolate. Made with skim milk for a healthier delicious hot drink. Creamy and tasty. Will never go back to supermarket hot chocolates.
3,"Of the few Hot Cocoa flavors we've tried, this is the best so far.  It has the richest flavor and I dont notice the artificial taste that others have commented on.  Its also very affordable compared to other k-cups right now.  I thought that the k-cup making process must have gotten more expensive over the last year, but now I know they are truely sticking it to us since these are still reasonable priced."
3,I used the minimum cup size to try and maximize the chocolate taste.  This did not help but if you like a weak chocolate taste then you will like it.
0,"This smooth black Earl Grey is a classic. Just the right amount of Bergamot oil. The brew isn't bitter, even if you over steep. Smooth and rich, but not heavy. I often reach for this tea on chilly mornings.<br /><br />Is this review helpful? Let me know, please vote. :-)"
1,"Are you looking for a relatively healthy option for soda?  well, look no further!  This product delivers that slightly fizzy drink you remember from the soda fountain days and a lot of flavor.  It also goes back to a serving size that used to be considered normal!<br /><br />Here is a quick summary of the things I like, and the things that I did not like as much:<br /><br />First, the positive:<br /><br />The flavor is very much forward and does taste exactly like what is described on the label. In this particular flavor, that means Kiwi and Berry.  Both flavors are definately distinguishable, which is very nice!<br /><br />The carbonation is such that it will not cause you to burp as you drink it.  It seems that many of the sodas out today have taken carbonation to the extreme.<br /><br />The serving size is finally such that you can enjoy it without feeling that you need to drink more than you really wanted.  I do not know about you, but I had it beat into my head at an early age not to waste food and I find that I will unconcsiouly drink all of anything that I open.  Not really a good thing when the smallest drink size is 12 ounces and most are much larger than that!  Yes, I know you can always pour out what is more than want, but how often does that happen?<br /><br />The can size makes it very easy to pack in a lunch, brief case, computer case, etc.  It is also easy to carry when you go for a hike (just remember to pack out the empty).  Speaking of packing out the empty, the aluminum that the can is made from is easily recyclable.<br /><br />Now for the downside:<br /><br />The pricing on this product is very high.  Crystal Geyser has essentially the same product and is priced much lower.  We have been buying Crystal Geyser since 2005 and it runs about 85 cents for a 12 oz bottle.  That is just the right size to split between two people.<br /><br />The number of calories contained in this drink is also quite high at 135 calories for 8.3 fluid ounces.  As a comparison, Crystal Geyser is 130 calories for 12 fluid ounces.  That is about 50% more calories in this drink!  This can be a real issue especially if you find that you need two cans of this beverage instead of the single serving size.  As an additional comparson, a serving size of Coca-cola Classic is 97 calories for 8 ounces.  So, do not think that drinking this instead of Coke will help you with a diet!!<br /><br />I have a bit of trouble with the label stating that the product is 100% fuit juice since they add carbonated water to it.  I think the way they get away with their statement is that they used concentrated juice blends (water removed from fruit juice) and then add back carbonated water to reconstitute it.  That is a fine line, but I think they would be better served by using the same statement that Crystal Geyser uses, 70% fruit juice.  That 70% is fruit juice concetrate.  The remaining 30% is carbonated water.<br /><br />Having to buy a case of 24 is also a real pain if you do not have a lot of storage.  Most other products come in packages of 4 or 6 (if not as singles) which can make it much easier to store.<br /><br />Ok, so overall, this is a good product that has good flavor and comes in a reasonable size container.  It makes a nice addition when you are looking for something to drink, just do not think there are fewer calories in this drink than in soda!<br /><br />The reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the calorie count, the price, the volume you need to order, and their labeling (stating that a product is 100% juice means just that, no additives and that is not correct since they add carbonated water.  I will give them the vitamin additives)."
1,"I've always liked Grape Juice- I didn't have it often, but liked white grape juice best, tending to prefer extremely sweet things. White grape juice & apple juice are near-universal bases for juice-blends, as they're bland & cheap to produce. Reading about their high sugar content & relative lack of vitality/food value, especially in comparison with heart-nurturing purple grape juice/wines, I decided to try darker juices.<br /><br />Welch's Concord Grape Juice was nice; Juicy Juice was OK; generic juices were generally not bad, tho of course they might not actually be juice but re-confabulations of concentrates plus high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). I've noticed over the past few years that HFCS tends to make me feel draggy; more recently, high fructose corn syrup's been implicated in our nation's widespread obesity, no pun intended.  ""Great, thanks, now ya tell me""... at least I know now!<br /><br />Kedem Concord was available at my local warehouse store, price comparable with other juices, and a label check said it was made of Concord grapes, with some Concord grape concentrate, no HFCS. With one swallow, it was clear to me that this product was distinctly superior in flavor, texture, non-obtrusive sweetness and tartness, and bloomin' wholesomeness than any other grape juice I've ever had. It has body, a velvet touch to the tongue, and many more dimensions than just one jolt of flavor. It's a genuine food, not a slug of sugar & color & liquid as currently so many so-called juices are, like a pre-mixed kool-aid that needs refrigeration.<br /><br />I'm far from wealthy & rarely buy treats (yep, even with the obesity!), especially juice, since actual fruit's better for me: more complete, cheaper, etc.  I am regularly buying Kedem Concord grape juice though.  Balancing dollars & quality, after again running my own consumer comparisons with other purple+/or concord grape juices, Kedem's still got it far, far over the other drinks available to me. I truly wonder what on earth could account for such a vivid difference.<br /><br />I still hate spending the money- it's good when cut half-& half with cheap raspberry lime seltzer, good mixed with other fresh & store-bought juices, good in cereal instead of milk (OK, an acquired taste, but I don't drink milk well), great mixed with nutritional (nicer than brewer's) yeast.<br /><br />I do have to include a caveat, tho, as it's preserved with Potassium Metabisulfite, which some might have reactions to, esp. asthmatics like myself. Man, am I fortunate NOT to have experienced any reaction to the Kedem Concord Grape Juice that I like so much!<br /><br />Yep- I likes it! And I whole-heartedly recommend it!"
0,I loved this green tea with acai and grape added to it.  It made me feel awesome and gave me lots of energy!  I would recommend this tea to tea lovers who like a bit of an extra boost.  I think the acai extracts help a lot and made me feel wonderful.
0,"I received a tin of this Rishi Organic Earl Grey loose tea as a gift a year ago.  I have enjoyed it immensely.  Having lived abroad, I have become accustomed to brewing loose tea, as well as using tea bags.  I love this tea so much that I only brewed it once in a while as a special treat, so as not to use it up all at once.  I wish it was decaffeinated, but other than that, it is truly enjoyable.  Because I like a weaker tea, I only use maybe less than a teaspoon per pot.  The aroma is great also.  The fact that this tea is organic is a bonus."
1,"I loved the Switch Kiwi Berry drink. It really does quench my thirst, leaves no after taste, and is not overly sweet. I hope the company can speed up its distribution of this product inasmuch as it's difficult to find in the grocery stores where I live. I think it's really a healthful drink, and am looking forward to finding it in my local grocery store. Oh, it just occurred to me to phone them and see if they will start carrying the product. Thank you Amazon for providing this product for us to try out."
2,"With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there's a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.<br /><br />Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch."
3,This is quite the buy compared to other hot chocolates. The kids love it quick and easy.I will order this hot chocolate again.
1,"""Switch"" advertises itself as ""100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't.""  While the ingredient list certainly does confirm the particularly natural recipe required to create this beverage, I'm afraid I cannot endorse it very highly.  I have long been perturbed by drinks of this nature.  Someone aspiring to consume a more natural beverage with no preservatives or other unpronounceable additives should probably altogether avoid the canned, carbonated-beverage front.  Anyone genuinely interested in eating healthy, regardless of the contents of ""Switch,"" probably wouldn't think twice about purchasing a drink such as this.  Instead, a can of this sort advertises to the hypocritical health nut, who has espoused notions of eating organically as a trend rather than as a genuine lifestyle change.<br /><br />The taste of the beverage itself is par for the course.  There is no added sugar, but it's still too sweet.  It's also more than a little too sour, and the fruity nature of it tastes a bit too much like cheap bubble gum.  I also cannot abide the half-hearted attempt at ""carbonation"" that this beverage and others like it undertake; it's carbonation that is a little too subtle to taste like anything more than the undercurrent of sour flavors.  Beverages that advertise themselves as ""carbonated"" should commit to the practice as well as the soda-pop industry has or else avoid the practice altogether; anyone truly interested in drinking healthy probably wouldn't be interested in a carbonated beverage anyway.<br /><br />In short, I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase ""Switch.""  I would drink it at need, when nothing else is available, but I find it to be a contradiction in form and marketing that clearly demonstrates the disingenuous motives of the company that produces it."
0,"Good flavorful tea.  Organic and tasty.  Stands up to some milk or to drink plain.  I love loose leaf teas and this is an easy way to find a good one.  It's nice to have it come in a 1 lb bag.  The bag is a self closer zip lock one, but it doesn't really work once you open it.  I just use chip clips or put it in anoterh container.  Enjoy!"
3,I got these cocoa cups based on my sister-in-law's recommendation.  It has a great flavor and is inexpensive.  Quite a good combination.  I'll be ordering more very soon.
0,"I've been enjoying this tea for years.  This tea is good mornings, afternoons or evenings.  My local store went out of buisiness....Thanks Amazon!  I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot."
3,"I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake. This is half a step above Swiss Miss. It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).<br /><br />Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.<br /><br />Stephen's chocolate has bad/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase."
0,These teas are terrific. I love the Earl Grey with Lavender and the White Pear tea as well. I think the Ginger Peach may be my favorite though.
0,"This tea is strong and has a smoky flavor - you can feel the leafy greenness though. It's not very bitter. I think it's a bit expensive for it is - but I haven't found a replacement. I guess we're paying for the fancy packaging, which in my opinion is a real waste, especially when you go through 3-4 cups a day like I do. Ahmed's Gunpowder green tea is stronger and is pretty good, but is available for cheaper than Dilmah's in the local Indian stores."
2,"Plum products are such a wonderful and yummy idea for the toddler, heck even the adult from time to time. I keep a full stock of every flavor fruit pouch Plum makes for toddlers. They make a great snack to throw in the diaper bag or back pack, whether you are packing a for a trip to the store, school lunches or going to Disneyland! These pouches have saved the day many many times. I have even grabbed one or two to add to my lunch when no other fruit was available for me, and it was really good! I have and will always recommend Plum to every parent I know!"
0,"I was sadly disappointed in this brand of Assam tea. Once properly brewed, the tea was weak. When I brewed another pot, I added more tea, in the hopes of making it drinkable.  The second pot was weak, and bitter."
1,"Taste like tang, only more expensive.  I'm not a fan of tang.  If you love tang and want some convenience, this just might be the drink for you."
3,"The hot cocoa does have a sugar substitute in it, but as far as I could tell, wasn't strong enough to leave that bitter aftertaste you get when they put a lot of it in the ingredients. If you have a very very sophisticated palate perhaps you could taste it a little, but it doesn't take away from the taste of the cocoa, so as far as I'm concerned it wasn't an issue. I would say this is on par with the type of cocoa you'd get in a coffee machine, which is fine, because I don't hate coffee machine cocoa. I have only tried the peppermint so far, and it tasted like peppermint... what can I say? That's what it's supposed to taste like."
2,my son can not get enough of these fruit purees.  i can not think of a higher standard of praise for this product!
3,"As far as single serve cocoas go, this is one of the best.  I wouldn't say it's as good as some of the handmade ones, but it's still good!"
2,"My son loves chick chick. This is the only baby food he will still eat. It is a little messy to open sometimes, but not a big deal."
1,"I liked it!<br /><br />Didn't know what to expect.  It has a variety of fruit juices such as apple, orange and grape, but clearly had a strong orange taste.  I liked the fact there was no added sweeteners such as HFC or sugar.  I'm not a pop/soda drinker, but I think if I served this instead of the traditional orange stuff in a 2 liter people wouldn't notice the difference.<br /><br />It's a bit pricy for orange soda and I'm sure orange juice would be better, but if you are looking for something healthier, this one's for you."
1,"I didn't read the label before I tried the drink, so I was a little surprised by the carbonation.  It had a tangy flavor which was possibly enhanced somewhat by the carbonation.  However, I've been a long-time drinker of the Tropicana Orange-Tangerine juice and Switch is simply not as good, IMHO.  If I wasn't already a Tropicana drinker, I might be interested in the Switch version of Orange-Tangerine, but I'm not going to ""switch"".  Sorry for the pun."
0,I find it is difficult to find black tea in the United States that is of decent quality.  I love PG Tips.  It brews up nice and rich and is reasonably priced.
0,I purchased this product mainly to try out the different flavors of tea. When I find the flavor I like I will probably buy a case of it. China mist tea taste great. As for those who have problems with tea leaves getting in the tea don't worry. I went to the local supermarket (HEB in Texas) and found empty tea bags in a box for about $5.They work great. Fill with tea and fold top and staple.
1,"I'm not a huge soft drink consumer, but I thought I would give this a try since it's being touted as a ""healthy soda alternative.""<br /><br />The Switch is a low-sugar carbonated drink that tastes fairly well, but is not as sweet as regular soft drinks or juices.  It felt a lot like a soft drink (that kind of weird filled-up feeling) but lacked pizazz when it came to taste - there wasn't a lot to the strawberry or the kiwi side and just made the drink feel a little flat.  I don't like super sweet foods, but I do like tons of flavor, so the drink didn't impress me too much.  This drink might be more of an acquired taste.<br /><br />I'd say sample this at your local grocery store or at a friend's house before buying."
0,"Bought this product to give to a family member who lives cross country and is going thru treatment for cancer.  Lemongrass tea is supposed to help with side-effects of radiation and chemotherapy. I tried it as well.  Have had other products containing lemongrass tea that tasted better.  Still, good value for the price and could probably be mixed with other teas to improve taste."
1,"I'm diabetic, so I'm always looking for natural, flavorful drinks without a lot of added sugar. Switch fits the bill for me. It's lightly carbonated, much less than a regular soda. The fruit flavor is very natural.<br /><br />The Orange/Tangerine tasted primarily like orange at first. But then I noticed a distinct tangerine aftertaste. The drink actually tasted very much like the tangelos I had the day before! Excellent!<br /><br />The can is also smaller than a regular soda can. That's okay with me, it's fine for a light drink when I'm thirsty. A full can of soda is sometimes a bit too much.<br /><br />Switch will probably become one of my drink alternatives, and I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors."
3,"I really like this hot chocolate mix.  I was concerned, when I read some of the reviews, that I would not like it but I like it alot.  To me it has just the right amount of chocolate and is not to sweet.  I would recommend this product."
0,Makes a great iced tea.  Make it and chill it and pour it over ice later on.  Works great!
1,"The only way we could make Switch Orange-Tangerine drinkable was mixing 50/50 with club soda. It was just way too sweet. It then tasted good, but Orangina and San Pelligrino both have awesome Orange flavored sodas out there with no need to mix! And surprisingly, imported San Pelligrino comes out to be cheaper because the cans are larger (11.3 oz. as opposed to 8 oz)."
2,My twin girls loved the gerber sweet carrots during first year as we moved to solid foods and I loved the price of the 12 pack through the subscribe n save program discount!  I also enjoyed having this food shipped directly to my doorstep when I needed it and always having enough in the cupboards to keep my girls happy.  I highly recomend this flavor and quantity through the subscribe n save program!
4,"Cats are such finicky eaters some times.  My old lady kitty does not like the canned cat foods, but she always went nuts whenever I'd open a can of tuna for myself.  So I gave her some one time.  These Tuna Cups are a great way to keep the tuna fresh enough over a few days, and good for travel.<br /><br />Same items can be purchased at grocery store, but buying in quantity through Amazon saves some $$.  Thank you"
2,"I like the Earth's Best baby food line because of the organic ingredients. Amazon has great prices (especially if you subscribe) and free delivery to your doorstop, which is convenient when you're a busy mom. My daughter doesn't like a lot of baby foods, but will eat this one. As other reviewers have stated, it's a bit runnier that other EB's stage 2 foods, so I add some oatmeal to it. It's also a bit bland, so I add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up. As an added bonus, it works wonders for her digestive tract! She had problems with constipation for about 2.5 months, sometimes going up to 10 days before we had to give her a suppository, and then I discovered that this food makes her poop every time (I also started giving her a sippy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the fiber). I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars because the main ingredients are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken. I wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein."
1,"The logo says ""100% of what you want.  0% of what you don't want"".  Well, I guess it is who you are talking too.  Even though the Kiwi Berry drink says 100% juice and 0% added sugar it is way too sweet.  The drink is refreshing but if you are thristy this 8.3oz can won't be enough.  The cost is too way expensive to enjoy this drink on a regular basis.  The cute can and unique drink combination doesn't make up for the sweet/tart taste, small skinny can and high price.  Save your money, drink water."
1,"There are things that I recall from my childhood that I would rather not - being stung by a bee, chicken pox, all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before I actually learned to ride it, and Tang.  Tang was that chalky, never quite dissolved in the water, powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as Kool-aid.  It wasn't Kool-Aid by any stretch of the imagination - it was Tang.  I've never heard anyone ASK for Tang... it was just what was there.<br /><br />So I get my can of Switch in the mail, eyeball the can... it's the same size and shape as an energy drink can... one of those ""single shot"" type cans.  Fearing that it was an energy drink I checked the label... says it's pretty much all juice, carbonation, and some natural flavors (including soy?!?) so I pop it open and take a swig.<br /><br />Now it MAY be 100% natural juices with some natural flavoring - but I know Tang when I taste it.  This is carbonated Tang... I know it is.  Somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered Tang and someone thought to themselves - what do we do with all of this stuff?  I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now it's not Tang, it's Switch!<br /><br />In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink - but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can - I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.<br /><br />Pros- Pretty much all natural - Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).<br /><br />Cons- I personally didn't care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink."
4,This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food.
1,"The first part of this review is a history of my health problems and what green tea bottles and sugar had to do with me finding the stash teas products. If you do not want to read that part, skip down to the bottom, and there is the review of the stash teas, only.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had a physical and my doctor told me that my Triglycerides were high. I was a serious soda drinker (sometimes as many as 5 cans per day, not diet), so I decided I needed to start drinking something ""healthlier."" I gravitated toward Green Tea because I like it. I averaged 2-3 1/2 liter bottles per day for 2 years (I also averaged about 1-2 cans of soda per day).<br /><br />I recently had my triglycerides checked again and instead of going down THEY DOUBLED. They were over 300 (over 150 is considered high). I about had a heart attack right there. Now, I am not an overweight person, and have had a fairly high motabolism, but I have started to create a belly (I call it a Dr. Pepper belly because that is my favorite soda. I do not drink alcohol of any kind). I am telling all of this to you because ALL of my other tests came in within normal levels, including all other aspects to my cholesterol.<br /><br />I did research and found out that if you are not overweight but have weight gain around the belly area, it might be due to consumption of a lot of sugar products. The excess sugar consumed, in this case, can be turned into trigylcerides. I looked at what I was eating and drinking to see if this was the case for me. What I found shocked me. The 1/2 liter bottles of green tea has MORE sugar in it than a can of soda. I checked several different manufacturers of green tea and I found them all to have about the same amount of sugar.<br /><br />I concluded that between my morning coffee, green tea bottles and soda, I was consuming over 1,100 grams of sugar a week ( or about 4,000 callories of sugar a week just in drinks)!!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I was looking for an alternative to the green tea bottles and found the stash tea products. I personally, do not have the time or patience to use tea bags, so I was interested in the tea powders. I ordered the lightly sweetened green tea powder and tried it. And I loved it. I then proceeded to buy the other 5 flavors of the green tea powders and love them also.<br /><br />There are 4 flavors that do not have sugar added, so I use a few drops of Stevia Glycerite to sweeten the drink. It does not take a lot.<br /><br />The best thing is that the tea powders cost about 1/2 or less than the bottled green teas I use to drink.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />To end on a personal note, I have altered my drinking habits and now drink 1 liter of the tea powder drink and 1+ liter of water per day. I still drink 1 can of Dr. Pepper on the weekend, but that is it. I have been doing this for a little over a month now and between my altered drinking habits and the fish oil pills, I have lost about 5 lbs. and am due to get my triglycerides checked in a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I hope this helps anyone that is in a similar situation to me and realize that just because it says its healthy does not mean it is."
0,As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad. I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great.
1,"I tried this, just one can, and am glad I had not bought more.  I do admire the company for coming up with an alternative to typical soft drinks but it's not for me.  I'd describe it as a sickeningly sweet syrup with very little carbonation added.  Plenty of carbonation is essential to a soft drink, it makes it sparkly and refreshing, plus it counteracts the sweetness.  As I said I'm glad it was just one can, my only regret is that I wasted 1.5 ounces of perfectly good vodka trying to make it more palatable and it didn't."
0,I have a lemongrass plant in my yard. I make tea from it but I wanted convenient tea bags to take to work or drink whenever I wanted. The tea from this box tastes exactly the same. It is some of the best tea I have ever tasted. I prefer to drink it hot but it can be made cold. It is such a relaxing beverage. I can drink it before bed because it has no caffeine. I highly recommend this tea.
0,"In cold weather, I brew this tea by the pot, keep it simmering, and brew a lemon ginger or ginger lemon tea, by the cup, made with this as the base.  My husband will drink it, and I can't get him to use any other medicinal.  (Hates licorise.)  It helped a great deal last winter."
2,"One of the things I just love about HAPPYBABY organic baby food is the unique combination of ingredients they offer.  I mean, how many companies utilize quinoa as the primary grain in their baby food?  I love that HAPPYBABY thinks outside the box to come up with an innovative mix of super healthy foods for our babies.  The bananas, black beans and rice work well together, both in taste and texture, and I know this is one meal my baby will gobble down every time.  Did I mention how much I love the portability of these pouches?!  I only wish they had been around when my older daughter was a baby!"
1,"To me, fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple - first example that comes to mind is good ol' Dole pineapple juice. The trend towards trendy little ""health"" beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic.<br /><br />There is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it. If I want a soda, I'll just grab one. I don't drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of ""100% What You Want"", there is nothing in here for me. If I want 100% Of What I Want, I will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water. If I want ""0% Of What You Don't Want"", well, why buy it?<br /><br />This is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity, and how to find a happy medium. I consider the likes of Pellegrino Aranciata, Orangina and Izze a luxury, and when I indulge it is a true delight.<br /><br />""Switch"" is a product that is not better tasting, proven healthier, or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives. Once again marketing is driving product creation and design, and that is a hateful concept.<br /><br />If you want a similar taste experience for about the same price,  pick up some Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus Nighttime- you'll stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great night's sleep."
0,"I originally ordered two teas from Art of Tea - the Silver Needles and the Coconut Creme. When my package came in, they had shipped the Coconut Creme and mistakenly bundled it with this Mandarin Silk tea by accident. I contacted Amazon and they refunded the Silver Needles and told me I could ""dispose of the Mandarin Silk Oolong as I saw fit."" Well, since I'm never one to turn down tea, I chose to dispose of it by, well, drinking it.<br /><br />This isn't a bad tea, first off. I don't have too much experience with oolongs, but I do like the flavor of this. However, I don't taste too much of the mandarin. It almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea, and it has a similar light green/yellow color. I drink it with a little honey.<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent tea. I don't think I'll order it again, but I'll certainly finish off this tin."
4,"I got these for my kitten and he loves them.<br /><br />The comment made about the bag being hard to open isn't really that big of a deal, I haven't had any problems closing or opening properly. Though, I would much prefer a container type packaging since those are easier to get into especially if you're training a cat you don't want to hold a bunch of cat treats in your hand because the bag keeps closing on you. But the bag closes/opens like any other zip lock.<br /><br />I feed my kitten chicken flavored cat food, so I try and offset the treats with a different meat and Wellness salmon treats work great and it's healthy without all those fillers.<br /><br />This review is for the treat NOT the bag, so I highly recommended this. 5 stars."
0,"I expected the flavor to be more like that of ""brewed"" green tea. It really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water. Although I'm sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants, I wouldn't order this again."
0,"I was looking for mint green tea I could carry with me to mix up while out and about. If that's what you want, then this product is perfect. I add a little extra water, but that's just my taste. So, if you're looking for mint green tea powder . . . look no further!"
2,we have been using this stuff for our baby for three years and she loves it.
2,"These pouches are the next best to homemade.  When I don't have time to steam and blend my own baby food, I always reach for happy baby!"
3,"Heat 8-10 oz 2% or whole milk, not quite to boiling, in your microwave. Add ~1-1/4 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Mocha Hot Choc powder + ~1-1/8 rounded teaspoons of Ghirardelli Hazelnut Hot choc powder, stirring to fully mix. Now add ~3/4 oz Christian Brothers VS Brandy. (Optionally) garnish with whipped cream or a small accent of vanilla ice cream and serve.<br />Notes: Not to be a brand whore, but Christian Bros (VS, not the more expensive VSOP) is the only brandy I've found to really have the right profile for this recipe. Exact proportions for all 4 ingredients should ultimately be to your own taste. Non-fat and 1% milk are NOT recommended. The brandy should contribute its flavor but not be so strong as to have an obvious alcoholic note. I've for many years used a 1.0 Mocha + 1.5 Hazelnut ratio, but lately the Mocha product hasn't seemed as intense, so I've adjusted. You'll know it's right when the mocha + hazelnut + brandy flavors are in such balance that none is too dominant -- the result will be a new experience ""greater than the sum of its parts."""
3,"One of the best tasting cocoa mix I have found , So easy to make just one cup for myself and the cup is<br />easy to clean with no grounds invovlved. Use with K cup lids"
2,"I received this product for free and was quite excited to try it out.  I have a child who has a variety of food intolerances and Namaste brand products have been a Godsend to our family.  Unfortunately this ""Say Cheez"" product is terrible and my child wouldn't touch it.  Normally, this isn't a problem when my child tries new foods, but I couldn't even stomach it!  It is NOTHING like mac & cheese.  The sauce isn't even creamy?!?!  Very disappointing."
0,"A friend brought a bag of this tea back from a trip to Taiwan, and shared it with his coworkers. I was amazed when I drank my first cup. The best word to describe the mouth feel is buttery. It's a wonderful, clear and elegant tasting tea. I've never had anything like it, and can't wait for it to become available. Everyone he shared it with wants to buy some. A Japanese friend who has been drinking green tea all her life said it was a special experience to taste this tea. Please offer it soon!"
1,"One of my favorite but rare indulgences is a can of orange soda; so I was looking forward to the combination of bubbles and orange flavor when I popped open my can of Switch Orange Tangerine. To my disappointment, it tasted more like fruit punch, perhaps because of the apple and grape juices in it to sweeten it. I would say the makers of this drink went overboard on the apple-grape combo, not just in the flavor department, but in the sweetness. It's sticky icky sweet, more than any of the cheaper brands (Sunkist, Crush and others) of orange soda, or the higher priced goodies like Orangina and the delectable Izze.<br /><br />It is fairly healthy however, with no bad stuff and quite a lot of Vitamin C (100% based on 2,000 calorie intake), All Natural, etc. My recommendation is for more orange, less apple/grape, or change the label flavor to ""mixed fruit."" It's 140 calories per cute little 8.3 oz can, and if you're not expecting orange you may like it. So far, the taste winner for cute little cans for me is Izze's Grapefruit, which has the perfect balance of flavor and carbonation, with the right amount of sweetness."
1,"I have tried a few of the different flavors of Switch now and I think this one is my favorite.  It has a nice smooth taste with a nice aftertaste of kiwi and strawberry.  As usual, the dominant first taste is apple and grape but the aftertaste comes on quickly.  It isn't too carbonated but not flat as well.  I think this is a great and refreshing drink.  I think it is so good you will wish the cans were bigger."
0,"My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from ""crisp and delicious"" to ""overpowering and slightly off-putting"". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere."
2,Our baby LOVES LOVES this food. We actually mix a jar with 1-2 scoops of rice cereal for breakfast and he gobbles it up. Earths best is the best!
2,My son loves these and they are great to throw in your diaper bag or take with on trips.  A lot of time I can't find fresh fruit while we are out and about that my son (he is 1) can eat.  These are great because it is actual fruit and he can eat it straight from the pouch.  Just make sure you help them the first couple of times or else you might have a bit of a mess.
0,"Powdered green tea with lemon & ginger provides quick daily source of antioxidant ingredients desired but in higher concentration and without the bother of brewing tea bags. Simply pour in water bottle, shake and be on your way.<br /><br />Product used to be available in local health food stores but is no longer carried. Much easier and more cost effective when bought in quantity on Amazon."
1,"I'm stuck on this. Cans are better, more lemon taste but them the price is sky high on the 22oz cans I switch to this."
0,"This tea is an excellent herbal tea. Love the taste and it's not as weak as most herbal tea is. I used to get it from the Commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so I checked on Amazon. Most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and I swear it said ""and free shipping when ordered from this seller"" above the ""add to cart"" button. I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products."
0,"Drank an instant green tea from a major producer for several years. Then they changed production and began using sucralose which I don't tolerate well.<br />Tried several different teas before I found Stash's instant green tea. I like it best with a little fresh lemon lime juice. I can drink all I want--don't even need sweetener. Plus as I understand it, it's just made from dried, pulverized green tea leaves--no chemical process. Also it's very coolby I get a discount forn having it delivered by monthly subscription. Phil K."
1,"SWITCH KIWI BERRY carbonated juice is a pleasant surprise.  Although I don't drink carbonated juices as much as I used to, I have been disappointed in the few that I have had in the past year.<br /><br />KIWI BERRY SWITCH is a nice carbonated juice.  The bubbles are very fine.  The flavor is not too syrupy, but with lots of impact.  I can taste the strawberry and the kiwi, but it is not overwhelming.  There is a touch of raspberry that I find stronger than the strawberry or kiwi.  I can taste the apple and grape slightly but the berry is much stronger and does not fight with it.<br /><br />There is only 8.3oz per can which can be good and can be bad.  I like it because I rarely want a big can of anything, so it is a nice size for me.  For a thirsty person on a hot day, one will not be enough.<br /><br />This juice stands up to some ice too without becoming flavorless which I also like."
0,"Super tasty, super delicious. Best tea ever, sweet and cinnamony. I actually like these better than the individually wrapped tea bags."
2,"Baby loved this one, but as he has progressed I had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if I have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands, it is all over! I think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one."
1,"We've tried Switch before, but the only flavor we were aware of was the citrus.  That was good, but this Kiwi Berry flavor is far better. It's tart, but has sufficient sweetness to balance the tartness.  Best of all, there are no unwanted ingredients in this.  It's basically a carbonated fruit juice. There is no added sugar, or, worse, high fructose corn syrup.  There are no artificial preservatives or colors or anything else that's typically added to a soda (or even a juice drink).  The 8.3-ounce can is a good size, too."
3,"The difference between an average cafe mocha and a fabulous, smooth beverage to be savored, is in the quality of the chocolate. Mocha powders, ground chocolate and ordinary milk chocolate chips are no substitute.  Ghiradelli Barista Dark Chocolate Chips are the answer for intense flavor and pure, velvety chocolate. These Ghiradelli chips will turn your not-so-great, made-at-home mocha into a gourmet cafe.  Read more at mocha.[...]"
0,"OK, first--I don't write reviews unless a product REALLY stands out to me!  I'm a Queen of Amazon.com Prime and receive requests all the time to write reviews on the millions of products I order (how many people know all their delivery guys by their first names?) SO, with that said--Yogi Calming Tea is the BEST calming tea for me because of the FLAVOR. There are a lot of Chamomile teas in the world and all of them give me the calming effect; but, the flavor--EH? This is the one and only one I actually like--maybe it's the addition of lavender?  Do your own taste test and see if you like the difference. I couldn't find Yogi's Calming Tea for a while in my markets so today when it popped up on Amazon.com, I was thrilled!  I subscribed to the auto-ship and save program so I will never be out of it again-HOORAY!"
1,"This is the second flavor of Switch I've had and it was... not terribly pleasant. First off, it seemed rather syrupy, but then I realized that's just because the sweetness factor is, apparently, set to eleven. It wasn't actually a struggle to finish it, but it was so cloyingly sweet it makes the average episode of ""Full House"" look like sour, cynical crap. It made me want to reach for insulin, though I don't take any.<br /><br />I suppose this might be a good drink for young children who don't have well-developed palettes, but if you're past the age of, say, nine, this probably isn't the drink for you."
1,"When I saw the Switch Orange Tangerine was available, I knew I had to try it.  I liked the Kiwi Strawberry quite well (better than some other reviewers did, it seems), so I was sure I would enjoy this one just as much.<br /><br />The initial taste of this Orange Tangerine carbonated juice is rather tart, and the carbonation just seems to make it more tart.  The aftertaste is rather pleasant, so if the aftertaste is what you're looking for in a drink, this is the drink for you.  My wife thought it tasted a bit like champagne, if that's any indication of what to expect from this drink.<br /><br />The flavor is different, and not at all what I expected.  Not very refreshing at all.  I would buy the Kiwi Berry drink, but I think I'll take a pass on the Orange Tangerine in the future."
2,"I got this food for my little one in all the flavors.  I have to say the chicken is her favorite.  The pouch is great for traveling, and is a good portion size.  The consistency is a little chunky, just right for mine with 4 teeth.  One pouch and some finger foods is perfect for her."
1,"I did not find this drink anything special in terms of taste; it is orange juice infused with carbonation. The juice is quite acidic and you don't feel that there is 100% fruit juice. The drink comes in cans rather than glass bottle which would have helped the drink maintain the juicy taste longer. It does not have any preservatives and it is gluten free, no sugar and no artificial flavors. This drink doesn't have any special features and it doesn't stand out well in a market crowded with many drinks.<br /><br />1. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />2. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q3ECXM"">Minute Maid Mixed Berry Juice, 24 - 10 fl oz Bottles, 240 fl oz</a><br />3.

0,"This roasted green tea was only ""so-so"" to my taste. I've found others I like better since I purchased this. However, it arrived in a box of TWELVE boxes (each with 16 or so tea bags). Way too much! Then I found that we can't return food items, so I now have a LOT of tea."
3,"It is so watery and weak, I had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate.  This makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly.  Each pod is 60 calories, so a full cup would be 120.  Will not purchase anymore."
0,I have been using the instant melon green tea for several years and truly enjoy my latte every morning. I have tried othwer brands and the are not nearly as good as the Island tea brand.
1,"If you're looking for a healthy alternative to your favorite orange soda, this might be a good choice for you.<br /><br />This is one of the better tasting Switch flavors, although it still tastes a bit like a flat orange Faygo or Slice drink.  It's good, but there's a bit of an aftertaste to watch out for.  It doesn't give you that weird filled up feeling that carbonated beverages seem to have, but if you're looking for some refreshment on a hot summer day (90+ degrees where I live as I write this), I'd stick to tried-and-true Kool-Aid instead.<br /><br />Decent, and a good orange soda alternative, but not life changing."
1,It is not a bad drink. It tastes great but nothing like Kiwi Berry flavor. I can taste more of the apple or punch flavor.<br />I like that it is all natural with no preservatives but I did not like the fact that it is very carbonated.<br />I also like the fact that it does not have corn syrup or sugar that is in most other carbonated beverages.
0,Wasn't sure I'd really care for this tea - as a k-cup option.  It's WONDERFUL! It's the perfect blend of tea and all you have to do is brew it in a minute. Add a touch of honey and sit and relax while the tea warms you up!
2,"Poor product.<br /><br />What was I thinking, looking for mail-order seafood at Amazon.<br /><br />Buy locally!"
0,"I started drinking this tea because I wanted to try something which would rid me of a persistent boil.  I was attracted by the word ""DETOX"" on the box.  I am on my second box.<br /><br />This tea is easy on the tastebuds and I believe that it is working."

1,"Switch Kiwi Berry is quite delicious, the flavor is very enjoyable.<br /><br />The only complaint I would have with this product is the addition of ""natural flavors"" which unfortunately is a very misleading term and can be very unhealthy substances but we don't know what they might be hidden under this generic term the government allows manufacturers to use.<br /><br />Still, from the ingredient list, this appears to be far healthier than almost all carbonated drinks currently being sold."
3,Super good price and the best k cup cocoa we have found.<br /><br />I am glad I found this for our family before the big cocoa season hits !<br /><br />love it
4,"Update 8/11/12  My cat has suddenly changed her mind about this canned food, ever since my last Amazon shipment, and she will not touch the stuff anymore.  I don't know if they changed the formula, or what... Now I have to find something else she'll eat.<br /><br />My cat, like all self-respecting felines, is a fussy eater but this product meets with her approval.  I give her a third of a can every morning and it keeps her happy all day (she eats dry food, too).  The Amazon price is a little more than I would pay at the grocery store, but my grocery store doesn't regularly stock it, so it's convenient to order it here and also not have to lug it home and pay for sales tax."
3,"When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa. I'm a bit of a hot cocoa nut, partially because I can't have caffeine, and partially because it brings back wonderful memories of playing in the snow and the fun of warming up afterwards. I really wanted to love this hot cocoa. I tried all three flavors multiple times, in different ways. I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue. I'm not sure what it is, but it has a faint ring of sour milk. It really lingers, and I haven't found anything that takes the taste away. I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me. I also took it to a friend's house and have tried them in three different Keurig machines, JUST to make sure mine didn't need to be descaled. So I guess my suggestion is to try it before you go for the multiple boxes."
0,"Great tea...I have checked other stores ie: Target, Kohls and they are more than this tea costs plus the boxes you get on Amazon are bigger quanities."
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry is 8.3 ounces and has 135 calories, 15 mg of Sodium, 34 g of carbs (11% of daily value), 33 g of sugar and oh yeah 100% of your Vitamin C daily value. Mind you, a 12 oz can of Coke has 140 calories, 50mg of Sodium, 39g of carbs and 39g of sugar. So apart from the no sugar added, preservatives and all the added artifial stuff, there is not much of a difference in nutrition between these two products. Need the Vitamin C? Drink orange juice. Yes, the Switch may be a tad healthier but it is still a can of empty calories. Moreover, a can of this may not be enough for most people, so double the calories if you decide to drink two.<br /><br />As for taste, it is too sweet. I agree with the reviewer that said that this tasted like apple juice. It does. It tastes like over sweetened apple juice. There is a slight (very slight) hink of kiwi and none of berries. The sweetness is too strong at first but it does grow on you.<br /><br />This soda has way too much sugar, almost as much as a regular can of soda, and it tastes like it. It is too sweet for my taste. Frankly, giving the calories for this small can, it is not worth it. Now, I would like to try the Diet version if there was one.<br /><br />As for price, each can is about a dollar. Way too expensive. This is like paying $1 for each of those small Coke cans (the 8 oz small cans). Would you pay a dollar for one of those? Neither would I."
1,"I repeat, carbonated fruit drinks can be too sugary. This drink reminds me of other orange soda brands without the extra sugar that combined with the metallic can always leaves an odd taste in my mouth. Orangina has a bit more flavor, but Switch Tangerine Orange is light and refreshing,."
2,"My twin 10-month old babies treat this one as dessert.  Their first Earth's Best jar they loved was straight sweet potatoes.  After water, sweet potatoes are the first ingredient in this one, followed by apricot puree.  That's dessert for them right there.  After that comes the chicken and then brown rice flour (not as good as brown rice though).<br /><br />This is a meal that babies around the age of mine are probably almost all going to love instantly.  Almost all babies love sweet potatoes for starters.  Add apricot puree and there's really not much one could do to discourage babies after that.  I recommend this flavor brand.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.<br /><br />The rice flour absorbed the water and gave it a real nice consistency, and the sweet potatoes gave it a nice color.<br /><br />Nutrition per label: 80 calories, 15% protein, 90% vitamin A, 2% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 6% iron.<br /><br />This one had the most vitamin A of all Earth's Best jars I've tried.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
3,"I bought this brand of hot chocolate K cups cause it had the best review on Amazon at the time.  The kids love it - they especially like the peppermint flavor which I can't see any other way to get except in this mixed box.  You get milk chocolate, dark chocolate and peppermint flavors.  I tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste.  I make it on the lowest setting on my Keurig which I think is around 7 ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them.  If you like a strong chocolate flavor this isn't it."
1,"One of my friends and her daughter are big fans of The Switch line of drinks because it feels like drinking Hi-C or Koolaid etc, without the sugar or high fructose corn syrup that is in just about every prepackaged drink.<br /><br />While it is encouraging to make something out of 100% juice, I find this to be too sweet. I can taste the kiwi and strawberry, but overall am put off by its sweet taste. I would suggest buying a single or smaller pack before investing in a case of 24. Having said this, the 8.3 ounce can would be perfect for lunches without the problems of the bottle version."
0,"I've used Lipton's Loose Tea for almost 50 years now and will never change to another brand unless Lipton's goes out of business.  The loose tea consistently makes absolutely the best glass of iced tea.  Tea bags (any brand) are no comparison, not even close to the same great flavor of Lipton's loose leaf tea. I have a large extended family with many friends, my iced tea is famous among them, for being the best....Thanks Lipton's!  And....thanks Amazon for the wonderful subscription service....Love it!!"
0,"I was SO excited to have found tea that tastes like aveda tea without the price. Based on the high reviews, I figured I would give this tea a try... I just received this tea and it tastes NOTHING like Aveda tea. It does not that that great licorice after-taste that makes you want to have another sip like Aveda tea. This tea also has cinnamon which is not in the Aveda tea at all. Overall, I would NOT recommend this tea to anyone who is looking for Aveda tea. It is very minty and has cinnamon in it."
4,"Mortimer Welch (http://twitter.com/MortimerWelch), who is the cat at the Center of the Universe, says:  ""The one thing that would be better than Kitty Kaviar would be if I were the head taster in a sushi restaurant that only served those raw fish thingys.""  In fact, Mort includes this passage in his ""Lessons For Young Cats"" series of lectures:  ""First, observe and note where the Kitty Kaviar is kept.  Second, misbehave TERRIBLY.  Third, go to the Kitty Kaviar storage area and bang on the cupboard door, push something over nearby that's loud, wail miserably, WHATEVER.

0,"I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.<br /><br />I've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I won't buy the teabags again."
4,"I've been on the hunt for high quality, yet affordable cat food for my little ones the past few months. I decided to order a case of Felidae (along with a case of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK8B8W"">Pet Guard Fish, Chicken & Liver Food for Cats</a>). Well, they love the Petguard but absolutely hate the Felidae, all three of them sniffed/licked it and looked at me like ""you're kidding..right?"" Even mixing in some of their old food and gradually trying to change them over wouldn't work, they'd sniff it and walk off.<br /><br />They LOVE the Petguard though and will inhale it the second I put it on their plates, so at least I discovered one good food they'll eat. I guess I'll donate the 8 cans of Felidae I have left to the local shelter. Despite the fact my cats wouldn't eat it I still gave it 3 stars because it IS a great quality food...if your cats will eat it."
1,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.

2,"I purchased two boxes of this because previously I had purchased Happy Baby Chick Chick and my daughter loved it.  When I opened this pouch up I couldn't believe the smell and texture of the ""food"".  It smells just like cat food because it's fish.  And the texture is just like canned cat food.  I have two boxes of this that I can't use because my daughter gags as soon as I bring the spoon up to her mouth.  I don't blame her, I'm gagging as soon as I tear the package open.  The nutritional facts are outstanding but they need to make it taste and look better.  The Happy Baby Chick Chick is an actual hearty puree with pieces of chicken and pasta.  This is not even close."
4,"My cats love this food. I have been buying the 3 pound bag, but with 3 cats, I will be switching to the larger bag. I am glad that Halo is available on Amazon, which makes it very convenient to order, but I also wish that more stores would start to carry this brand as well. I am always looking for the best for my babies and as far as I can tell, this is it."
1,"I decided to try the Switch Kiwi Berry drink because I'm trying to find tasty alternatives to regular cola and I don't like most artificially sweetened drinks. Switch did a great job with the kiwi and strawberry flavor of this beverage, but I can't shake the feeling that it's a drink that is pretending to be healthy even when it's not.<br /><br />The Switch can states this drink is made with 100% Juice, all natural, with no sugar added and no corn syrup. That must make it healthy, right? Wrong. This tiny 8.3 ounce can packs 135 calories and 33 grams of sugar! How is that possible? Switch uses fruit ""juice concentrate"" which is just a nice way of saying they process fruit into a sugar syrup and remove almost everything that makes juice healthy in the process. Juice concentrate is barely any better than corn syrup.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is a very tasty drink, but don't buy it if you're looking for a healthy beverage."
3,"we have bought several types, brands of hot cocoa k cups. These our definitely one of the best! They have a great flavor and everyone in my house liked them, even my 9 year old who only likes some hot cocoa loved this. It is creamy, it actually tasted like a melted candy bar, very good taste, not watered down like some of them. Of course the price is amazing, but don't let that fool you! This is one of those products that is actually good even though it isn't very expensive."
0,"I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly."
2,My daughter loved this stuff. It is all natural and made very well.  Good to mix with other things as they get older too!  Beats Gerber.
0,"I first had this tea in a restaurant, immediately I tasted the natural sweetness of this tea. It was not a bitter tea,nor was it too sweet. It was like the perfect cup of tea."
4,"At 60 years old I have had the care of cats my entire life.  Presently have four cats, three of which were ""barn cats"" and one came out of the woods and adopted us.  These cats love and gobble up Friskies Pate varieties ""Mariner's Catch"", ""Sea Captain's Choice"" and ""Ocean Whitefish with Tuna"".  I also serve as a ""foster parent"" for the local pet shelter and find that these 3 varieties of food are the best tolerated and completely consumed of all varieties.  The ""Salmon"" pate is very rich and I use it only as a special treat.  Incidentally, my cats always reach great age on Friskies.  Our cat ""Kitten"" died at 23 years old. She jumped off of a high bed and severely injured her spine and at the time it happened the Vet asked what food we used all of those years.  It has always been Friskies...dry and wet pet foods.  I find it is the best value and maintains our pet's good health right to the end.  The youngest cat that has died in our care was 18 years old and I have have had 28 cats as permanent pets, and countless foster pets over the years."
4,"So fishy that our cat is all over this the moment I cut the packaging open.  The smell is very strong.  My baby did not take to it.  It is our cat's food now.<br /><br />Their other products are much better, but this one is way too fishy.  It doesn't smell pleasant when you go out to a friend's house or restaurant.  If I just wipe the spoon and bowl without washing after feeding this and put it back in the backpack, after I get home the whole thing reeks."
3,"This is the best Keurig K-Cup hot chocolate you can buy. I've tried others, but will never buy any other brand again."
0,"This is just the quick iced tea fix I have been searching for.....it is perfectly balanced between the green tea and the natural, refreshing blueberry flavor. Keep in mind this is NOT sweet and sassy, like most instant tea ""add to bottled water"" packets. This is the real deal. If you want sweet, then order the sweet variety or add your favorite sweetener. When you add the powder, it is green....looks alittle weird, but once you can get past the looks, it's true love. I think it's delightful that I am actually consuming the entire leaf--finely ground to which it dissloves....thus making my water become murky, swamp water before my eyes!  That has to certainly be more bang for your buck for the level of antioxidants, opposed to the old brewing way.<br />  I have had a very difficult journey (until now) finding yummy, healthy (& QUICK) unsweetened flavored teas......my second favorite is the Celestial Seasonings COOL BREW bags....the blueberry green tea is also delicious, but not nearly as refined as this ""top shelf"" Stash.<br />I am pondering more flavors for my next order!"
0,"*****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: ""Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair."" I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****"
3,"This brand is by far the best K cup hot cocoa not that that says much, but it is thicker and less disgusting than the rest."
2,"Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months, and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat.  I cut up cantaloupe, apple, banana (even used sweet potatoes a few times)-- just whatever I could get at the restaurant-- and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat!  It's great because I didn't have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks, and he got to try out new foods.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again."
1,"I usually cringe a little before I do a natural juice/carbonated beverage.  There is frequently something of an aftertaste that is unpleasant.<br /><br />This is refreshing, light, very bubbly and leaves a bright taste after with no cringe effects.<br /><br />I definitely would buy this drink."
2,These snacks are such a great finger food.  Unlike a lot of other snacks for toddlers we have tried they actually taste good.  My only problem is wanting to eat them before I give them to my daughter.  They are not messy and are the perfect size for little fingers.  The fruit melts very quickly in my daughters mouth and is so easy for her to eat.  All the flavors are excellent but this is our favorite.  Both the blueberries and apples taste fresh and sweet but with no added sweetener.  Great job designing a healthy snack for young children.
0,"This tea certainly exceeded my expectations!  While pricey, you most certainly get what you pay for.  The tea is an amazing blend of nuanced flavors.  While the Bergamot is center stage, the tea itself is first-rate.  When you open the can, be prepared to meet a fully-formed and highly complex Earl Grey.  If you have been drinking ""retail"" Earl Grey, this one will bowl you over.  Every time I enjoy a cup, I'm so happy I made this purchase.  FYI, I have found that 2 teaspoons steeped for about 3 minutes in a cup of water delivers a perfect product, flavorful, but never over-powering or bitter.  If you like Earl Grey, try this product!"
0,"This tea actually tastes the way a rose smells.  It's like sipping on roses when you drink it.  I'm glad it can be purchased on Amazon because I looked in every regular food store as well as the more unusual stores, like Trader Joes, that carry unusual food items and could not find it."
0,"I am not a fan of green teas, but I really love this one.  It has a nice ""non-tea"" taste.  It's hard to find in stores so I got the 6 pack.  Great price and shipped really fast."
3,"KCups are a godsend; among KCups, these are near the top.<br /><br />The Keurig brewer is a blessing, hot beverages in seconds, mostly coffee; but there are greater and lesses among the coffees, and so, it seems, among the hot cocoas.<br /><br />This is so rich and vibrant, it announces itself from two rooms away.  Silky, smooth, bursting with all the things chocolate is supposed to deliver, it's a must-have in this household."
4,"Unfortunately my dear sweet cat did not think this food was so dear or sweet. She only ate it when she knew there would be nothing else and she NEVER finished what I gave her. She normally eats EVERY SINGLE BITE of her food but constantly turned her nose up at this. She really enjoys Bench & Field's Holistic Natural Feline Formula (from Trader Joe's) and also Purina's Naturals Cat Chow. Sorry, Halo, I REALLY wanted her to like this!"
3,"They have some really good hot chocolate. I got a single pack before and it was so good that I reordered some more. I like to make a mocha by brewing one of these and then one coffee (use a big cup).<br /><br />One thing to note: these dont have a strainer inside, the entire contents are meant to be used (unlike the coffee Kcups) so it will feel empty once done. I would not recommend brewing on the smaller cup settings. Use a standard mug or larger because the smaller settings wont get all the chocolate from the inside to come out.<br /><br />Also, kids may not like the peppermint flavor.... But that is my favorite one. If you don't want to get the variety pack, they sell the individual flavors too."
0,it's difficult to describe herbal type pills. with no quick results it takes blind faith really. i reckon these are ok? i got what i ordered quickly
3,What I really like about this selection is the choice of three different hot cocoa chocolates.  My favorite is the mint chocolate for it not only tastes like mint chocolate but it has the aroma of a hot mint chocolate.  The milk chocolate and dark chocolate are equally flavorful as well. The price through Amazon is very reasonable.
0,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012BZGHS"">Stash Premium Mint Green Iced Tea Powder, 12-Count Packets (Pack of 6)</a> Light mint taste, easy to mix powdered tea, great on ice."
4,"This version is ground.  NOt my current cat's favorite version, but he really likes the taste. I do wish they'd make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too.  My previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean. But, neither wanted it more than once or twice a month.  Why, I don't know but it seems to be a little richer than the others."
4,"I got this for my 12 year old cat who stopped eating his regular dry food, as the kibble was a little too hard for his teeth.  I ordered this because it was described as having soft kibble, but was just as hard and looked exactly the same as the Science Diet I had been feeding him.  He eagerly went for the food when presented, but stopped eating it after a few bites because it was too hard.  Luckily, I didn't buy a huge bag, as this food is expensive."
4,We tried all flavors for our cats and the rabbit was the apparent favorite for all of them. Took a recommendation from catinfo.org for this food as it is closest to the diet that a cat would naturally eat. Coats are softer and glossy. Energy levels seem to be up. Quite pleased with the results so far.
1,"This is my second can of ""The Switch"" that I'm reviewing under the Amazon Vine program. And while this one is perhaps a bit better it still has the same basic issues -- it's over priced at almost $1 for a mere 8.3oz can in a 24 pack, but more importantly it really just doesn't taste like orange or tangerine at all. The ingredients actually list apple juice as the first type. Now why would you put apple juice in an orange drink? Now don't get me wrong, it tastes exactly like one would expect carbonated juice to taste...but the flavor isn't all that appealing.<br /><br />I love orange juice, drink it every day. I'd love to try carbonated orange juice...but this is far from that. It MIGHT be a good substitute for normal soda for kids, but I can't imagine any other real reason to get this."
0,I read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that I did. I have purchased other Numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of theri products.
0,"Great taste in a medicinal candy.  I found some at Knott's Berry Farm.  I will reorder these from Amazon.  Some seem to dislike the taste, but I find it refreshing.  Read the claims for this herbal tea.  I have ordered seeds to grow my own horeshound herbs, which grow wild in abundance in America. I recommend you try this as something different and traditional."
1,"I had hoped that this would taste like Pina Coladas but it doesn't.  It is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue.  I wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is good in mixed drinks.  I have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol.  If you are going to drink this straight, it helps if it is really cold....almost frozen.  If you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing I can taste in it,"
0,I love this product. I use it every morning on organic waffles. I also put some in my tea. Buy some. You will like it.
0,"When we visited Turkey last Xmas, we drank straight or honey-sweetened Turkish tea along with delicious baklava several times a day to make up for the cold. My boys fell in love with Turkish tea there. Back home, we tried to find some good Turkish tea. I ordered several kinds. After doing thorough testing (!!) we decided that this was the best tea among the 4 kinds we sampled!<br /><br />The taste: very clean and pure. A light, well pitched, fragrant component. A hint of sweetness in the background.<br /><br />We brew it in a cast iron Japanese tea kettle, pour boiling water in it, then dilute it in the glass or mug to the concentration we want. Purists beware: we often sweeten it with honey, and I typically add a drop of lemon:-)"
0,This is the only way to make good good iced tea. you will never taste iced tea as good as homemade and it is cheaper on amazon than in the supermarket!
2,I am 76 years old and I have eaten these nuts for many years.  The ones mailed to me are very tastey.  The only problem is that they were jostled around and a lot of the red skins came off and went to the bottom of the can.  No big deal but it would have been better if they had stayed on the nuts.  I will order from Amazon again.
0,This chai is more flavorful than the Stash black tea chai I had ordered before. Also has the bonus of being organic. Can recommend the Good Earth brand  basically across the board. Almost all of their teas exceed expectations.
1,"I  highly recommend Switch if you are looking for a soda that doesn't have refined sugar and is loaded with flavor.  Sweetened with fruit juice (as opposed to high fructose corn syrup), this will definitely quench your thirst.  Plus, all you Tangerine lovers out there, this is the next best thing to eating the actual fruit!"
4,"This tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too -- he's constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these. There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these. I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that must've been fixed b/c I've not had any problems at all -- in fact, they securely bubble wrap these, then place them in an air-cushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time."
4,"...however, for the price and additional shipping cost (if not receiving that free), I would not say this is a such a good value. Not sure what makes the tuna more pricey than something like the freeze-dried salmon. If these were the only treats available to the cats, they likely would not last even one week in this small amount. In the future, I'd be more apt to open up a 69-cent can of tuna, which they are just as fine with."
3,"I bought some of this chocolate for my mother who can't have much caffeine. She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its ""food"". and the company who makes it basically said ""Sorry, but it sucks to be you"". So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use."
4,"My cat really enjoys these pet greens. We need to break them in half for him or he finds it impossible to chew them. No big deal there though as it makes the bag last longer. I was floored on the huge price increase on these. In september 2011, I ordered these for 3.99 a bag and now in November 2011, they are 7.07 a bag. (same size bag and everything) Wowsa! Hoping that the price comes back down soon. ^..^"
0,"I made Chai tea - as well as a home made chai ice cream and just a chai milk without the tea + cloves, star anise and a few other spices.  But you have to have the cardamom pods and these were wonderful."
0,"Hy, I'm very happy with my  Twinings green tea, is my favorite. Twinings Green Gunpowder Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)"
1,"The Switch is marketed as ""100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't""...meaning, the only things in the can are juice and carbonation. There is no added sugar, no corn syrup (high fructose or otherwise), no preservatives, no *artificial* colors (""natural"" flavors and colors ARE added), and no gluten.<br /><br />The Orange-Tangerine flavor seemed to taste almost like carbonated Sunny Delight - according to the label, the juice flavors are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. It was quite tasty and had just the right amount of carbonation - almost like a soda that has been opened and left to sit for just a few minutes to let some of the excess gas escape. It was light and, dare I say, refreshing. For what it is marketed to be, it does quite well.<br /><br />The only downside is that I could probably do something similar at home - buy some Sunny D and add some sparkling water or seltzer, and it would probably be cheaper. However, if you're out-and-about and need something light, tasty and not loaded full of extra nonsense, then this would certainly fit the bill."
4,My finicky calico just LOVES this food.  One of the few wet foods she will actually eat. It is loved by our other three cats as well.  Will definitely be buying this again.
4,"I had been offering my housecats the Fancy Feast canned foods with the Fancy Feast kibble always available.  My black Coonie-mix cat would regularly vomit up the clearly identifiable, undigested, highly dyed, cutesy shaped, Fancy Feast bits (usually on my cream colored carpet!)  This cat also had already had to have one tooth extracted and I wanted to try to feed him something that would set better on his tummy.  After doing some web researching, I ordered our first bag of Royal Canin Indoor Mature Cat 27 a month ago.  We went through the gradual change over thing but I don't think it was really needed as the new food was readily accepted.  The first bag has been eaten and joy, and the upchucking has ceased!!! Even his  hairball ""gifts"" are getting smaller and much more infrequent.<br /><br />My other Maine Coon is 12 and oddly enough, hairballs never seemed to bother her but, she was eating less and less.  She was becoming less active and just didn't seem to be interested in eating kibble or canned and she was noticably loosing weight! Her vet said she could be heading towards a thyroid problem but he wasn't ready to put her on medication yet.  I am happy to report that my sweet girl has really taken to this Indoor Mature Cat 27 diet.  It is helping her get back to her normal, Maine Coon size and she does seem to be feeling much better, even joining in on some playtime with the young'uns!<br /><br />Who knew a change of diet could work such wonders?  Clearly, the attitude of ""kibble is kibble"" is out the window.  How could I ever return to feeding my cats a food that would make them vomit?!"
1,"I am a fan of the Bellini drink, white peach puree and Prosecco (a Italian sparkling wine) and I was NOT disappointed.  I mainly brew it for ice tea.  I disagree with some of reviewers in that not only do you taste the raspberries and peaches you can also taste the sparking wine.  This is my primary drink in the summer.  To give it a little kick I will sometimes add a peach liquor or peach flavored rum.  I recommend it highly"
4,"I have 6 feral cats that I trapped, neutered/spayed and released.  They still hang around our property so of course we feed them.  They really like 9 lives and I believe it is good for them.  Being old and my husband handicapped, it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of wrestling with the bags at the store and unloading when we get home.  I am very satisfied with the product and Amazon.  The subscribe and save option is even better as I don't have to remember to order it."
0,"My daughter loved the little tin that came with her Adagio tea set so much that I got her a cannister of this for Christmas.  I think it will end up being a regular gift as we all love it so much.  It really is delicious, and with green tea being so good for you, we drink it all the time.  All the products I've tried from Adagio have been wonderful."
3,"I am a big fan of chocolate and cinnamon, and was looking for a stronger cinnamon flavor than Stephen's Gourmet Chocolate Cinnamon (which is very good, but very subtle).<br /><br />This one has way too strong of a generic spice flavor for me.  It almost tastes like someone brewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.<br /><br />Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.<br /><br />I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.  But otherwise I have 3 more canisters to try and give away - if you haven't tried it, buy as small of a pack as you can for a taste test first."
3,So far Grove Square has the best hot chocolate K-cups.  We have tried a couple others but they don't compare.
1,"While Switch Orange is VERY orangey, it also tastes of something else interesting. It's fizzy (but not, in my opinion, excessively so) and tasty, and I'd consider buying it. I seldom buy or drink soft drinks or sodas; I just don't care for all the fizz burning my nose. Switch didn't do that. Hurray!!!"
0,"If you're looking at Choice tea, you're probably already aware that this extraordinary company was a pioneer in the use of organic, fair trade ingredients for tea.<br /><br />But Choice is also innovative both in design and in creative ingredient combinations. As for design, Lychee White is part of Choice's new line, characterized by an innovative biodegradable pyramid-shaped tea bag which allows for the use of regular loose tea leaves. As for creative ingredient combinations, this healthy white tea is enhanced by the ethereal marriage of natural lychee flavor and sublime organic osmanthus blossoms. The flavor and scent is one to savor and celebrate."
0,This is good iced tea.  It is hard to find locally in the Fall and Winter.
3,"I didn't expect much from powdered cocoa in a cup, but here's a tip: put on 8oz setting, then add a 1:1 ratio of heated milk. It tastes amazingly good!<br /><br />Of course if you add a little Baileys Irish Cream, it tastes even better."
0,"I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water, and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well. Well worth every penny."
0,This tea has a smoky undertone to the flavor. All three cans had the same smoky flavor.  Other than that the tea was fine.
2,"My 9-month-old absolutely adored the old recipe of this product, which was organic chicken, sweet potatoes, and brown rice pasta.  She would gobble up an entire pouch every time we offered it to her, and often ask for more.  Unfortunately, Happy Baby had to go and ruin a good thing by reformulating the product!  The new Chick Chick recipe consists of organic chicken, vegetables and quinoa, and my baby completely DESPISES it.  We've offered it to her several times now, and each time, she makes a face, spits it out and turns away from the spoon.  I see from several of the recent reviews that many parents and their babies feel the same way about the new recipe.  I can't for the life of me figure out why Happy Baby would change the formulation of its Chick Chick baby food when it was perfectly fine and delicious the way it was.  I definitely won't be buying this product again, unless Happy Baby goes back to the old formulation.  Grade: D-"
1,"This flavor of this drink is the better of them. Really nice and sweet. Not overdone, not weak, just right. My only complaint with these drinks is that they are carbonated. I wish they weren't. But if I had to choose between this and the other... I would choose this flavor again."
0,Rishi is the finest quality tea you can imagine! This Earl Grey explodes with satisfying aroma and flavor! Don't say you don't like tea until you try Rishi!
2,"My daughter loves this. This goes very well with bread, crepe or any sort of breakfast items. It is buttery smooth, and has a rich chocolate flavor. Be warned - It is addictive."
2,"I was reading the other day about which items you shoud buy organic<br />and fruits and vegtables were the top of the list. So dahh..it dawns<br />on me what have I been feeding my baby ? We changed to Earths best<br />I feel better, feeding the best.<br />Also we use Earths best Formula..when we changed our baby now sleeps<br />thru the night...and that REALY makes me happy !"
0,My sister had this sent to me as a birthday present. I enjoy a good cup of tea and this did not disappoint. Delicious and strong green tea. Only wish the package was bigger so I could enjoy more of the tea.
0,"THis ice tea, is like heaven on ice.  must try if you love lemon and giger.  Great price for the content.  You can make a pitcher with 4 bags and add some lemon and whatever your sweetner you prefer.  Great for barbeque parties or a tea with the ladies"
0,"I finally finished my box of the Blueberry Green Tea Powder and wanted to try something new!  So glad I tried this flavor as it is now my favorite!  Just add it to a cold bottle of water, drink it as is, or add a few drops of Stevia or Agave and you are good to go.  Very refreshing!!  Will be packing this on my trip to Mexico!"
0,"this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... it's clean, bright, fresh...<br /><br />great delivery...again quality... just try it..."
1,"Switch is fruit juice that looks and drinks like a cola. From the packaging and branding to the carbonation, it looks to sub in for your favorite soda or energy drink and - let's face it - that's not a bad thing!<br /><br />The drink itself is pretty good. A fairly concentrated blend of fruit juices plays well on the palate by refreshing carbonation.  It doesn't feel thick or sticky like other beverages in 8 oz cans, but it does have a hint of that cough syrup flavor that is so common these days. Fortunately that bit isn't overwhelming and doesn't hang around long.<br /><br />After the swallow Switch is sweet, bubbly, and light - a perfect substitute for most sodas. At about a dollar a can, Switch is a great choice for anyone looking to cut back on cola or make their kids lunch a little healthier without making them look uncool. Even if it does still seem wrong to pay more for straight juice than heavily processed artificial flavors."
0,"I was literally not prepared for the exquisite and lively flavors that this brew offered as it instantly became my favorite Rooibos tea. This organic Rooibos makes the perfect daily cup of tea that can be enjoyed in any quantity. African herbal tea is rich in many essential natural elements as it is not allowed to oxidize making the flavor more fruity and literally weightless. This tastes like a cross between soft black and green tea, a gorgeous pumpkin color when brewed and since it's caffeine free I can drink myself silly before bedtime and it has not kept me up yet. The subtle richness of soft pulpy mellow woods is silky with a pleasant sparkling green aftertaste which I find myself craving all the time.<br /><br />So far every flavor of Numi I have tired proved to be a winner and a cup of high quality in both flavor and taste is always guaranteed and only a short boil of water away. After a hectic day this is the best calming and tranquil beverage that is not only delicious but also so healthy!<br /><br />- Kasia S."
0,I love this tea so much. It is like magic. And the taste is WONDERFUL! Thank you so much for making my new favorite tea.
3,This is really tasty hot chocolate.  I like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference...
0,"I have had better teas, but they were more than twice the cost of this one. This is my second purchase and I am very happy of the quality at the price I paid. I will be buying this item again in the future."
0,"You'd be surprised how much Runa Tea can help you in your daily life. Thirsty or not, Hot or cold, this tea can help you in many ways. As a college student studying to be an entrepreneur, I can't just take prescribed drugs all the time to keep my attention span up. Instead, I turn to caffeine all day every day. Runa Tea has been one of the few products that have really caused me to feel refreshed as if I was just hydrated after a run, as well as feeling focused as if I were ready to write a 10 page paper from scratch. I don't know what it is, but it just makes you feel good in every way. Personally, I love the cold tea- but as a consumer everyone needs to find their niche, as I am a huge hot tea drinker and chose the cold version- Either way, same thing.  You need to try it. And then try and contradict our 5 star opinions! :)"
3,The kids love the hot cocoa and I like the fact that I can get the stuff shipped to me when I need it without worry of order.
0,"Love this tea...especially love triangle bags more flavor & the tea is what I remember it to be...Happy<br />Came right on time in great shape...Happily enjoying my PG TIPS!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5JLE"">PG Tips Black Tea, Pyramid Tea Bags, 240-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>"
4,Cats have many things that pass through their mouths causing tartar buildup and eventual decay of teeth. Just like with people they need a little help with their dental hygiene. These tidbits - shaped like litte fish - are a tasty and effective solution. Difficulty is ignoring the crys for more.
2,"I love the fact that this is multi-grain baby food.... but like people food, good for you things NEVER taste great... so mix it with bananas or some other fruit. Yes, the texture is a bit difficult to swallow for little ones, hence why you want to thin it out. I read the other reviews and can't believe they never thought to mix this food with something else."
3,This is a great buy.  I love this hot chocolate because it is very low in sugar and has a good taste.  It isn't messy like regular hot chocolate as it is all dissolved before it hits the cup.  Would buy again.
0,I love this tea and I hate that it is so hard to find! I am so glad it is available on Amazon!
3,"I ran into this product at a bed and breakfast.  Unlike most hot chocolate mixes with another flavor component, the raspberry flavor in this is an equal partner with the chocolate.  You don't get just a hint of it that soon gets lost.  You taste the raspberry with the first sip and the last sip....very very enjoyable.  Highly recommend."
1,"Normally, anything with strawberry and kiwi flavor tends to actually be mainly grape juice and taste like over ripe fruit.  Not this one... it's absolutely delicious, not overly sweet, and actually tastes like the fruit pictured on the can.  I like that it is naturally sweetened, using no corn syrup.  It's not too sweet either.  Just tastes like fizzy fresh fruit.  Highly recommended."
1,"After trying the strawberry/kiwi flavor, I found it to be very light. I liked the taste, but I didn't think it tasted a lot like strawberry or kiwi. It kind of tasted like a carbonated light fruit punch. I just didn't like the after taste. The can is also very small for a drink to be so expensive. In all honesty, I don't think I would buy this, especially in this economy."
0,I love this tea and have no complaints!!!  I just want to comment on how the tea is packaged.  It comes loose in little plastic baggies so if you want to use it you have to have some sort of filter.  We have an iced tea maker and used a cone coffee filter which works just fine.  I did buy a 2 inch tea ball but the loose tea just falls right through it so I guess I didn't buy the right thing.
2,"I like the portion size on this one.  Son started eating this at 5 1/2 months.  No issue with feeding him cold or hot he eats it.  I like the benefits of DHA and I like the listed Vegetables/Grains.<br /><br />I like the pricing, no tax, and free shipping to my door.  Can't beat the price for pack of 8 in the stores.  we get this food delivered too.<br /><br />The packs are easy to throw in diaper bag w/spoon and feed him.  Less mess and fuss.<br /><br />Our son's 11 months now and still eats this."
3,These truffles melt slowly in your mouth with a wonderful flavor and smoothness. And you want just one! The most satisfying chocolate I've ever had.  I want some NOW!
2,"We love this vegetable pouch for our 18 month old, and more importantly she likes it too. I like that it has sort of a dry texture compared to basic blended vegetables. I stir a touch of milk into it each time and it makes it really creamy. She always finishes it, and its one of our favorites."
4,My cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money..it is just sitting in our cabinets.  I will donate it to a shelter...
0,"After having to give up coffee years ago due to a medical condition, I tried many different kinds and favors of tea until I stumbled  upon this in a small bakery that had recently opened nearby. I loved it and have been drinking it every morning since over the past couple of years. The sachets are perfect for a larger mug, the paper wrapped are fine for smaller cups or mugs. It's a hearty tea that I find satisfying and delicious."
1,I really like the flavor of this one! It has a low acidity but still full of flavor! Now I have to have it every morning and I am having trouble finding another one I like this much.
4,"This is the only food my cat will eat.  If I buy another variety or brand, it sits in her bowl until it gets stale & I throw it out."
0,"It was a pleasant surprise to learn that one can buy loose tea on Amazon, though I admit to a degree of trepidation because I had never heard of Davidson's Tea before. Their catalog of available teas is quite large, and it quickly became a matter of choosing teas for now and saving new teas for later, because their descriptions are both interesting and helpful. Their packaging is good; delivery was timely; but the real test is - how does it taste? I enjoy the full-bodied flavor of Assam, and this is an excellent tea. I recommend it highly to other customers, and I will be re-ordering when this lot has been happily consumed."
1,"Didn't realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-. Gave it away the next day at work."
2,LOVE earths best but my 8 mth old daughter only liked one of the 4 selections. i highly recommend buying just one of each from the store and having your baby test them before buying these in bulk. walmart usually has them for .60 each
3,"The flavor of this cocoa is good, but I found that it was a little too watered down with the normal amount to water. The second cup was better when I used less water."
1,"I can't figure out why anyone would want to drink this stuff!? The can is 1/3 less in size than a regular can of soda, it's got more sugar and more calories and it doesn't taste very good. It's also a bit expensive for what your getting.......need I say more?......I think not!"
2,I'm not the one who eats these so I can't give the best review but my son gobbles them up so I'll take that as a 5 star rating from him and I give it 5 stars since I know it's organic and I don't have to worry about what he's eating.  Now if I were to review his vegetables I might have to deduct a star for him but that's just because he doesn't seem to care for peas much.
0,"This tea is incredible. Mind you I  am not an avid tea drinker. I'm more of a coffee person. I bought this tea to alleviate stress and deal with irritability. I was pleasantly surprised to find out it tastes wonderful too. The aroma in itself is calming and the lavender and slight anis flavors are just incredible. It combines the benefits of great flavor,  being really calming without putting you to sleep,  and easing tummy troubles like bloating and indigestion. It is a truly enjoyable tea. I just bought 6 boxes and am about to stock up on some more."
2,"This has been my baby's (now 21 months) favorite since he was 10 months old. He seemed to be bored of it after a couple of months. My husband then was going to claim the rest of pouches as his snacks and started to have it with an Avocado, my son reached for it. So now, we mashed, somewhat, an avocado in the Ratatouille and he would inhale it down in no time! It's also a go-to meal when we are having spicy grown-up food and I'm too lazy to cook him up something else. It also helps him ""go"" regularly."
2,We have to hide these boxes and pull them out when our one year-old daughter won't eat anything else.  She will always eat these.  Her brother and sister are always sneaking and eating them too.
0,"Lady Grey is a unique and delicious tea. No other tea maker has been able to copy it's flavor. Very much worth a try, if you like a milder Earl Grey taste with citrus."
1,"This product is billed as an all natural anti-oxident and electrolyte replacing beverage.  Sort of like all-natural Gatorade with anti-oxidents.<br /><br />Like a sports beverage, it too is also kinda bland.  I love some of the Gatorade flavors, some not so much.  This drink falls into the not so much category for me.<br /><br />It is sorta sweet, sorta pineapple-y, and also sorta bland.  My wife commented that it has a slippery feel in her mouth, like the glass had soap in it still.  I didn't think it was that bad but the drink really didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />In the end, yes, this drink is probably much better for you than a glass of apple juice and definitely better than some sugar infused punch.  But as a sports drink, I think I'll stick with plain old gatorade; it's cheaper and contains fewer calories per serving.<br /><br />If going the all natural route with your juices/drinks is of the utmost importance this may be something to consider and bump this review to 3 stars."
1,Light carbonation mixed with fruity blend made this a refreshing and flavorful drink.  The kiwi and berry flavors are good together.  This could be a good way to switch yourself or the kids off of soda and on to juice.
1,"This is the most original root beer I've ever had. It has a kick: one for your head with the guarana (most energy drinks have this) and one for your tongue (it has capsaicin, the part of hot peppers that burn your mouth). This combination sounds weird i with cane sugar, but this is my favorite soda.<br /><br />I find that either people love this or hate it so try it at your grocery store first before you buy a case."
3,"There is way to much surgar in this hot chocolate it's like having sugar flavored chocolate, I am going to have to buy some pure powedered chocolate and mix it in the bag, other then that I would say it would taste good if it was not so sweet."
0,"The tea is what it was advertised as! The tea tin and packaging were also in excellent condition. The tea tastes nice, just like normal english breakfast. They are non string tea bags, round instead. Lovely for a gift!"
3,"Ghiradelli might not make the best chocolate in the world, but their chocolate mix is my personal favorite. It is rich and mixes easily without the residue in the bottom of the cup that lesser brands suffer from. The mocha flavor is very good with a strong coffee flavor that doesn't overpower the chocolate. This is simply great hot chocolate and well worth getting if you enjoy mocha. It also mixes very well in milk shakes!"
1,"I had to try this Orange Tangerine flavor because I had tried the watermelon/strawberry and didn't like it very much, but wanted to give this company another shot. I do prefer this Orange tangerine; it has a nice citrus flavor with that carbonated fizzy on the tongue sensation. I give it a 3, better then the watermelon/strawberry and on ice I drank the whole can."
1,"Switch tastes more like chemicals than juice. I was expecting something along the lines of Orangina, instead it's closer to orange soda but without the carbonation level that makes orange soda enjoyable. For a small drink (8.3 oz), it's pretty high in calories (140). Frankly, I don't think the flavor is good enough to justify the caloric level.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're die-hard soda drinker, this might be a better option for you. If you're a die-hard juice drinker, stick to juice. If you want fizzy juice, add a little seltzer to your fruit juice."
0,"Given this blend's orgin, the name ""English"" Breakfast is a bit of a misnomer, because it was a Scotsman - a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale - who first marketed his particular blend under the name ""breakfast tea."" It proved so popular, however, that it was soon copied by tea houses all over Britain, many of which then added the word ""English,"" which has been part of its name ever since.<br /><br />English Breakfast can contain black teas from a variety of origins, among them India, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Malawi and China. Stronger than most other teas, the blend is made to match the traditionally heavy English breakfast, which to this day often includes pork, sausages and eggs, and for this reason English Breakfast tea also maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. It is certainly less refined than Darjeeling or even Earl Grey, but hard to beat as an everyday ""work horse,"" and as good or better an early morning pick-me-up as any kind of coffee."
4,"I don't want to give away any secrets but I buy these treats for my 3 cats.  They are all addicted to them and ask for them after dinner.<br /><br />The dog treats are the same as the cat treats but at a cheaper price.  I was worried that they would be huge or something since they are sold for dogs, but not so.<br /><br />I give each cat about 6-7 treats per night.  The only ingredient is SALMON.  How much healthier can you get?!  My cats' coats are extremely soft and silky, and my vet recently commented that she thought it must be the treats!<br /><br />If you are looking for a healthy option when it comes to your animals instead of the supermarket trash that has un-pronounceable ingredients in it, GET THESE!"
0,Detox tea is good for helping to cleanse the body of most of the modern world fast paced living. Very good price and fast delivery. would buy it again...
3,"Enjoy the taste, milk free product. Ilike milk in hot cocoa, just can't see adding powdered milk. B U T, it is considerably less expensive at a local chain grocery store in my area. I prefer a mix of this and Ghiradelli ""Double Choclate""."
4,my cat loves this  first time I have found a cat food that he will eat and every time i go in the kitchen he thinks<br />its time to eat
0,"This tea has one of the cleanest, most refreshing flavors I have ever tasted. Licorice and mint is a winning combination anyway. This is a great way to cleanse your system, detox and purify yourself, all at once."
4,"My cats are not picky eaters, and lick their bowls clean of virtually anything i feed them (wellness, fussie cat, fancy feast, bff). I tried feeding them Tiki Cat on 2 separate occasions, and my cats threw up both times. I thought they may have gotten sick the first time from eating something off the floor, but when it happened a second time I was certain it was the Tiki Cat. I'm not sure if I received a bad batch, but I will certainly never be purchasing a Tiki Cat product again."
4,"I have fed my 2 cats these treats the last 2 days.  Within 5 minutes of eating them, they are both throwing up.  I will be going back to the Three Dog Bakery Treats.  Expensive but have never made my cats sick.  Why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews?"
0,"First, let me state that I brew most of my tea in a gaiwan, hence, I use loose leaf tea.<br /><br />White tea is one of my favorites so I'm always on the lookout for a nicely priced Bai Mudan.<br /><br />As much as I love Bai Hao Yinzhen, I just cannot afford to drink it exclusively due to the volume of white tea I drink.<br /><br />I thought this was a pretty good price and when I opened it up it didn't look too bad either.  Much to my surprise, after taking the first layer off the top (I transfer my tea to good tea tins) it was nearly all powder/dust with hardly any intact leaves.  This is extremely problematic if you don't use any filters or screens (like me).  I don't mind when some tea leaves get in my tea and it is pretty much normal if you don't pour through a screen, however, this was so broken up that it was just unworkable.<br /><br />I have only opened one bag at this point so there is a chance that it was just that bag or possibly even a bad batch but at this point I most likely won't be ordering it again.<br /><br />That being said, the whole leaves that were there (on the top) looked fine.  It does have a bit of a green tea taste (vs some other high quality white tea I am used to), however, it isn't bad or anything.  Definitely drinkable on a regular basis if the bag wasn't mostly powder.<br /><br />I took a couple pics so I will post them...keep in mind this came in two pouches, I poured into tins and that is where I took the pictures (the product does not actually come in tins)."
1,"Unlike another product I reviewed for Vine, at least this product does not have sugar per se in it. It is carbonated water added to a concentrate mixture of (in this order): apple, grape, tangerine and last - as well as least -- acai concentrate. The first two on the list, apple and grape are two of the most common ""fruit"" sweeteners used in beverages etc. That is why the product tastes sweetened.<br /><br />It has 140 calories -- quite a lot for 8 oz of flavored carbonated water -- and all of it is from carbohydrates (36 grams) and over 90% of the carbs (34 grams) are sugars. Apple and grapes have some of the highest concentrations of ""fructose"" a fruit sugar that not only commonly appears in commercial beverages because it is sweeter than regular cane sugar and thus it is cheaper to use, but it is also known to cause diarrhea, particularly in children.<br /><br />So another drink on the hit parade of ""pretend"" healthy drinks- appealing to the masses' concern for their ever-growing girth -- and deluding them that this will help forestall continued growth.<br /><br />You are better off drinking diet coke. You would be even more better off buying the sparkling flavored waters with no calories. My favorite is Bella Familglia -- in pomegranate, lime, lemon and orange flavors -- and is sold from time to time on Amazon as well as your local supermarket.<br /><br />Better yet, buy some organic pure fruit juice -- such as pomegranate and pour  1/8 cup in a glass of your favorite sparking water or a quarter cup in a 16 oz bottle of your favorite sparkling water. At least it is the actual juice and not some fructose extract."
1,"The Kiwi Berry drink may not have sugar addded, but it sure tastes sweet. Part of it may be the other fruit jucices mixed in (Apple, Grape, Raspberry, and Strawberry)with more Apple and Grape than Kiwi. For me it was too sweet and did not taste too much like Kiwi fruit."
2,"My daughter likes these foods, but is not as keen on this flavor.  I think it is the the texture, this flavor is a little drier and more crumbly than the other flavors.  However, if I am not worried about the mess it almost makes a decent finger food for her."
2,I bought this for my grandson.  I used it for the in between stage from strained food to small finger food. He really liked this. He loves sweet potatoes so this was great!
0,"I have used this product in the past and was highly satisfied. It works very well. I would just caution first time users not to make the tea too strong or your results may be ""too good""."
2,This is a terrific baby food.  It has beef and spinach AND tastes great!  It was the first meat baby food my son would eat.  I tasted it myself and it's quite good.
0,"Ever since I discovered tea the way the British drink it in the late '70s, I've been searching for a good black tea that, with a bit of milk, would produce that same rich, smooth cup of tea.  This is it!  I love it, as do the many friends I've served it to.  I highly recommend it!"
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40"">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />The Switch Kiwi Berry is a nice beverage alternate to soda, however, it packs a whopping 33 grams of natural sugar in its 8.3 oz. single-serving can.  I found the taste refreshing and not too sweet, but I am not a regular consumer of carbonated beverages.<br /><br />While this would be a fine alternative to sugar-added, preservative-laden beverages, it contains a high degree of carbs.  Also, the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates.  If you're watching calories, the 135 in this small can might be better spent on real food."
0,"Once again, Twinings has come up with a winner.  This variety pack is highly recommended by me.  The flavors in this pack are the best of the best.  You should not be disappointed with this purchase.  When it comes to tea, Twinings is the best!!"
1,"Very nice drink.  I enjoyed it, especially when it was chilled.  The flavor is powerful but not overpowering.  I loved the bubbles.  Great drink."
2,"My twins recently got a little picky on the baby food... We tried this one, and they both love it.  They are now 10 mos old.<br /><br />My twins love it!"
1,I tried this along with two of my children and we all agreed that it tastes like spoiled OJ but fizzier. Maybe it would be an acquired taste but I won't  be drinking it again to find out.<br /><br />Oddly enough the black cherry version is quite good.
3,"I'm a huge Stephen's fan but I'd only ever had the regular Milk Choc hot cocoa.  Deciding to be a little more health conscious I thought I'd try the fat-free variety.  DON'T! :)  Okay, if you aren't expecting it to be like the regular version then go for it.  It's much better than other fat-free hot cocoa varieties but doesn't do justice to regular Stephen's Hot Cocoa.  I'm going back to the good stuff."
3,"My wife absolutely adores this cocoa. Very easy to make, just hot water which for her is a plus.<br />She prefers this over Ghiradelli."
2,"Earth's Best Turkey Vegetable Dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey. You can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level.  I just can't find non-sweetened and non-dried cranberries even at the better food stores.<br /><br />Apples, carrots and turkey taste good to my 10-month old growing twin girls.  Babies love carrots since they're sweet to their taste, so that made a great addition.  The whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistency.<br /><br />The ingredients per the label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, mechanically separated organic turkey, organic whole barley flour.<br /><br />In addition to 12% protein and 50% vitamin A, it has 6% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through Earth's Best.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
4,"My cats love the food, and it's referenced on the list of ""Companies that Don't Test on Animals"" through the PETA web site."
1,"Great taste, solid flavor, sparlking. Good thirst quencher that is a great substitute for soda."
1,"The product description says that it's ""just juice, bubbles and vitamin C."" Really, it's just the last two. It's not entirely flavorless, but I've tasted plenty of beverages that are much better than this one with a lot less carbonation.<br /><br />And, honestly, this ""healthy"" drink is rather easily replaced by a multivitamin pill. It's not really good for you, it's just not directly bad for you. Sincerely, I'm fairly sure that sucking on my couch cushions would garner you more nutrition than a Mountain Dew, so it's not like ""better than soda"" is really setting the bar high.<br /><br />Rather disappointing, particularly compared to the other Switch beverages."
4,"Both my cats love Whiskas in any flavor.  My female cat, Sophie, is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone.  When she hears me tearing the Whiskas Pouches, she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food.  She never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone.  She will then sit by her brother, Samson, to get more food if he leaves.  After he gulps his food down and see's his Sissy waiting for some of his, he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw, look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth. i can always count on empty bowls when I buy Whiskas.  The price at Amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store."
2,"this is the best snack on the planet. every little molecule of this item is vibrating with the love that comes from growing, harvesting, making and distributing it in harmony with nature. it is soooo good. people think that just because it costs a little more than a bag of monocultured corn chips it's expensive, but in terms of the taste, of the nutrition, of the total value, it is not expensive. it's not cheap, but nothing green is, or should be."
0,I just loved the tea.  We just add a little honey and sit back and relax.  It has a slight citrus flavor which I find very refresshing.
1,"It's a refreshing drink when served cold. A bit sweet when warm. A little tart, but tolerably so.<br /><br />The flavor is less orange than tangerine, yet I can distinguish several different ""layers"" of citrus in it, including the orange. It's an interesting sensation.<br /><br />I am a little bugged by the fact that an 8.3oz can (2/3rd-size) manages to pack more junk calories in than a full-sized can of cola. It's also supposed to be 100% juice, but reconstituted grape juice is practically pure sugar and there are ""natural flavors"" noted in the ingredients list as well as a soy warning which to me implies some sort of MSG, probably added with the citric acid.<br /><br />So, maybe it's not an especially healthy beverage. It's still tasty and provides a diversion from more typical sodas."
0,"This is the favorite green tea in our household.  Been using it for years.  Was happy to find it here on Amazon, otherwise we had to travel about forty miles to an oriental grocery store to purchase it.  Can't even buy any leaf tea of any kind in regular grocery stores any more.  By the way ""Ban Cha"" in Japan simply means common or everyday tea.  Not ceremonial."
0,This tea is very good.  I discovered it while visiting in California. The moment I got home I searched local stores for it and I was not able to find it.  Finally I decided to see if Amazon had it and they did and I bought two boxes.  As long as they make it I will buy it.
1,Very Natural flavor. Not loaded with sugars and other things not good for you. Has a fresh taste of orange/tangerine and the carbonation is great. Great taste. I enjoyed this product and would recommend.
3,This is the best drinking chocolate I have had on the market.  The spices are perfectly combined for an authentic Mexican taste. The seller delivered 100% as promised.<br />Thank you.
4,"I was reminded of my mother's cat when I read the comments about vomiting. Mom's cat gulps the Whiskas Temptations WHOLE and resembles a Kirby vaccuum! If you inhaled your food, you would vomit too! With my kitties, it is an entirely different story - they love them, they chew them, they purr. These are not a dietary supplement, they are a TREAT. I even managed to train my eldest kitty to ""shake hands"" using Temptations. I will definately buy them, again and again."
4,"BEWARE! This is not the ""flavor"" displayed on the label of the pictured can of cat food in the photo.  This is a photo of the original formula's label.  I ordered 5 cases because the label indeed showed a photo of the label on the ""Classic Chicken ENTREE with Brown Rice""..this was the ORIGINAL formula.  Friskies phased out the original formula and REPLACED it with ""Classic Chicken PATE with Brown Rice"" (PATE IS ON THE LABEL OF THE NEW FORMULA).<br />My cat LOVED the ORIGINAL formula.  Friskies ""replacement"" formula is different (texture is nearly the same, so it has to be in the ingredients) MY CAT DOES NOT LIKE THE NEW FORMULA.  I believe this is an outrage.  Displaying one picture and then sending an entirely different labeled can?  I am disappointed in Amazon.  NOW, imagine the shipping expense to return 5 cases of canned cat food???? I had to separate the cases from the huge box in order to even lift them into the house!......$73+ down the drain.  To add insult to injury...I can get this replacement ""PATE formula"" at my local Petco store (on sale) for the SAME PRICE per case.  So much for trusting the photos of products displayed for sale on Amazon."
2,"i am constantly adding baby food to regular food [pumpkin, sweet potato into pancake mix; carrot, tomato, greens into spaghetti sauce; etc..].  so when i saw these i thought it would be a cool mix in without changing the consistency.<br /><br />tried the sweet potato into our pancake mix.  i couldn't taste them, nor did it change the color of the mix.  which for most older kids probably would be great.  however, my toddler calls them ""orange pancakes,"" so we ended up dumping in a jar of sweet potatoes anyway to make them orange.<br /><br />also added the carrots to a 4 cheese noodles i made.  it colored them great and you couldn't taste the carrots.  so if you are trying to be sneaky, then these will work, it's a very, very small amount of powder, so it'll boost the nutrition without being detected.  with that said...<br /><br />in wegmans where i live, they were 1.10 a pouch.  i didn't think that was bad considering the organic packets  [plum/happybaby] are anywhere from 1.00-1.50.  EXCEPT, that nurturme is equivalent to a 2.5 ounce jar, NOT the typical FOUR oz!  this is equal to those 1st stage baby food jars that are tiny.  their picture seems a little deceptive, because i think when most people see a pic of a baby food jar they think of the normal size ones- not the tiny ones.<br /><br />so in the end, you are paying more and getting less.<br /><br />like i said, i didn't buy these to mix up and feed my baby, i just wanted to try as a mix in.  in all, i think it's a cool concept, but as for paying double for the same product, ehh dunno.  might buy a pack and use it here and there as a mix in."
2,"Its my daughter's favorite first and foremost.  For me I love that i can get lentils, there aren't many stage 2 or 3 vegetarian choices."
4,"I switched to this cat food from Purina One mature formulation. Chicken is the first ingredient! Many other cat foods have rice or chicken by-products as the first ingredient. This food is specially formulated for the older, indoor cat. The other good thing about this food is that it is low in protein (27%), which is important for older cats because of decreased renal function; Purina One mature formualtion has too much protein (37%). My cat really likes the taste and he had no problem switching to this food from Purina One. This is a high-quality cat food and although it is a bit more expensive than other brands, my cat is well worth it!!"
0,"Lipton loose tea is great for brewing iced tea or hot tea. Mellow yet intensely flavorful, this tea works very well with iced tea makers or coffee brewers. I wouldn't use a coffee maker that's been used for coffee, though, as the coffee effervescence will overpower the tea's flavor. My only gripe is I would like to see loose tea available in larger packages. Lipton used to sell it in one pound boxes, but now it's only available in 1/2 pound boxes. This six pack helps make up for the problem somewhat. We drink iced tea like some people drink their coffee: all the time! So loose tea works great for us (4 TBSP makes about a gallon) It's much easier than messing with a dozen or more tea bags per gallon. With the free shipping, the price per box is equal to or less than the purchase price in our local grocery stores and Wal*Mart stores, and that's with delivery to my front door!"
4,"My cat has an iron stomach. She can eat absolutely anything and everything and is always getting into my ""human"" food and has never thrown up. I gave her 2 of these treats and within 20 minutes, she was wheezing and throwing up all over my carpet. I didn't connect it at first but when I gave her the same treats the next day, exact same reaction!<br /><br />I have tried several different flavors of this same brand and she has had the same reaction! If you are trying these with your cat for the 1st time, only give them 1 of them and just wait to see how they react before you give them anymore."
3,"I love hot chocolate and am always trying new ones, but this was the absolute worst cherry hot chocolate I have ever tasted!! I was hoping it would be good so I bought 2 cans. After 1 cup, I threw both cans away. If you want a really great cherry hot chocolate, add 3-4 teaspoons of the cherry juice from a jar of maraschino cherries to your favorite milk hot chocolate. YUM!!! Add more if you use dark hot chocolate."
0,"Harney & Sons Paris tea is what first got me hooked on tea, so I thought I would try a couple of their other flavors.  This one is pretty delicious. I'm not sure how, but the vanilla flavor somehow makes the tea taste thicker.  I know that sounds weird, and maybe not super delicious to some of you, but I mean it in a good way. :)  I guess it makes it taste more luxurious...like the consistency of good hot cocoa."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40"">The Switch Kiwi Berry</a> does taste great but the problem is that it tastes nothing like Kiwi Or berry.<br /><br />This flavor has more of a punch flavor is you ask me. The Apple, grape and other juices used in this - You can taste them to well and they over power the Kiwi Berry flavoring.<br /><br />I'm only giving it 3 stars because it still tastes good, just nothing like kiwi berry"
0,"Close your eyes and the entire room smells like a gin and tonic!  Obviously, I like gin and tonic so that's my issue but the oil of bergamot in this brews pungency might be a bit much for some. It certainly will keep the insects away too.<br /><br />But I like fragrant teas so I recommend this as an exhilarating Earl Grey as<br />the black tea base is superb as well."
2,Are they kidding? Who would name a product this? Really!!! Love the part about preventing it from spurting...LOL!
4,I have found this cat food to be the purrfect choice for both my cat with IBD and my cat with Diabetes. Howard and Miss C are thriving on this diet of Turkey and brown rice and  enjoy it so much more than prescription diets. The price was great too for a premium cat food.
2,"My baby is ready for some new foods in her diet so I decided to give Gerber 2nd Foods a try. Gerber 2nds is vastly different from the other brands of 2nd baby foods that we have tried. The other brands seem to be similar in consistency. There is really no difference in the consistency of Gerber 1sts and 2nds. The difference is that 2nds includes turkey, chicken and beef and 1sts are all fruits and veggies. My baby did not find Gerber 2nds appetizing. The color and odor of the chicken is also nothing like actual chicken. I placed the lid back on the jar and refrigerated the jar since I was hoping to try it with her for another meal. The next day I got the Gerber 2nds jar from the fridge and reheated it. When it was reheated the food was so runny that she could have drunk it from a bottle. The consistency does not keep from one day to the next. If you're looking for a baby food with chicken, turkey, or beef then I would recommend that you try Beech Nut Stage 1. My baby loved the Beech Nut turkey, chicken, and beef. The only problem is that the major grocery stores in my area do not sell Beech Nut. Next trip that I make I plan to stock up on the Beech Nut!"
2,"My mom had gotten some of the dollar store knockoffs - they weren't bad and they certainly were cheap, but the look on her face when I gave her these was worth every penny.<br /><br />Although, I think she's managed to eat most of them in a couple of weeks and still stays 120 lbs... LOL"
2,"this baby food is the greatest.  My granddaughter loves it and even calls it by name. she is 15 months old and still enjoys it, and I have peace of mind because I know I am feeding her a good balanced meal at a great price"
3,"I purchased this product as a gift for my mom who simply loves this cocoa.  When the local supermarket where she purchased the cocoa stopped stocking it she figured that was the end of it.  Ha!  Little did she know that I would find a way to track it down on line.  And on Amazon!  She was surprised and pleased.  The price is good, as is the cocoa.  I would only be more happy if I could get an assortment."
1,I enjoyed this carbonated Kiwi Berry fruit juice.  The carbonation gave the drink a more complex taste than just plain juice.  It is also a healthy alternative to sodas with no nutritional value.
3,"This is absolutely the best hot chocolate out there. It is not too sweet, so more for adults than for kids. Easy to make. Just add milk. No intense mixing required. Dissolves easily."
2,"My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.  Not all the time, but often.  The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.  He won't eat much when he's in pain, but these are easy on his gums.  They are organic and a quick meal.  My son is strong and a very healthy weight.  I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible.  Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.  He loves the whole line."
1,"Being a root beer lover I was excited to see Sky Blue Free at my local Earth Fare market. I mean, you can't go wrong with a natural soda, right? Wrong! Like the the other one-star reviewer, I thought it was bitter, had a chemical smell and ended with a horrible after taste. I've had good diet root beer and bad and this ranks as miles below the absolute worst. I'll stick with Diet Barq's, which is far cheaper and frankly is the best rootbeer, period!"
3,"This review is for their dark chocolate. Most who like dark chocolate are into the pure chocolate taste and its health effects...not the sweetness! Just as with good coffee, its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there aren't that many sweet-freak-fatties drinking it. The ancient Incas didn't use any sugar at all with their chocolate!<br /><br />I did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their aren't many companies that even make one, so kudos to them for that."
0,This was a present for my grandmother who loves this tea. She was so pleased to get it. I am glad that I bought it and had it sent to her.
2,I like this one better than all the other ones by Earths Best. The variety is good and my son seems to enjoy them all.<br /><br />If i am going away for a weekend this is perfect for feedings. It is packaged well and again the variety helps!
1,i cant keep enough of this in my house. my kids drink it like its going out of style. i love it cause its so easy to make just water and the packet the best part is that is sugar free.
0,"I love this tea. It has a mild flavor and no caffeine. The only problem is that the string comes detached from the bag after about a minute in hot water. This doesn't happen once in a while, it happens nearly every time.<br /><br />Triple Leaf Tea, please fix this bag issue. It's frustrating to the point where I may look for a similar tea from another company."
0,Tazo Zen is a great tasting green tea.  I would recommend to others at least to try.  They serve it at Starbuck's stores so it would be better to try there first (although they will charge you $2 for a small).
4,"When my cat Tyger was diagnosed with Feline Bladder Disorder, there were many limits on the foods he could eat. He also would not eat anything that wasn't pate formulated.  Then I found Indoor Chicken Pate which he loves and also his sister loves.  Thank goodness for Amazon as none of the stores in my area carry this product.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G0NKVO"">Friskies Selects Indoor Cat Food, Classic Chicken Entree with Brown Rice & Garden Greens, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>"
0,Nice tea. I can steep up too 3 times. It has a strong cranberry flavor. Probably would be good as a cold tea. I recommend if you LOVE cranberry.
2,"Please do not send the salmon as baby will no eat it, please send the chicken on Happybaby Organic Baby Food. I am to received this once a month.<br /><br />Marlene layman"
1,I was going through about 2 litres per day of various soda drinks.  Switching to this has really brought down my caloric intake and I have dropped about 5kg with this being the only change in my diet.
0,"I always thought that Captain Picard was a bit of a wimp for preferring Earl Grey tea but when made according to the detailed instructions  this version is a rather ""Manly"" tea. Very strong with a bit of an edge, quite suitable for Star ship Captains, gentleman adventurers and  with a little extra water the rest of us too. I like it better sweetened than unsweetened and think it needs sugar and/or milk to smooth it out. The Bergamont flavoring is a bit strong in my opinion but if you like an intense Earl Grey version, this might be just your cup of tea ( I had to say that).<br />There is quite a bit of caffeine in it so it might not be the best bedtime beverage. This tea Goes well with classic tea accompaniments such as cookies, cakes, cucumber and ham finger sandwiches etc. and would also be good to accompany a meal.  Not really the tea you would choose to serve with sushi except for that style of California Roll  that is made with chopped crab (or Kreb surimi) and Mayonnaise, Which was really enhanced when served with this tea."
0,"This is the most delicious Earl Grey tea I have ever tasted. The aroma is wonderful, and the amount of bergamot in this blend is perfect. I use about one and one half tablespoons in my 17 ounce tea press and steep for 4 minutes. You can use less or more tea, to taste. I love the fact that I can re-steep the same tea leaves a second time, and enjoy another pot of tea that is as delicious as the first. If you are already an Earl Grey fan, I promise you will not be disappointed. If you have never tried Earl Grey, why not start at the top? Enjoy!"
1,I really wish amazon would have sent me more of these...I just started drinking this drink and I finished the whole can I one time..<br /><br />I totally love this drink and now really have SWITCHED<br /><br />This is so much better than 0 nutrition Carbonated drinks.<br /><br />Its got real fruit extracts not just essences..and is a clear smooth pleasantly carbonated drink.<br /><br />I am totally switching to this over colas...I hope my supermarkets sell these soon.
0,After having only 2 previous Assam teas I can say this is without a doubt the best one I have tried yet. The price was the deciding factor when I purchased this and I am not displeased. I would recommend this product without hesitation.
0,I have such a hard time finding loose tea locally. Being able to order my favorite Lady Grey tea on Amazon is convenient and timesaving. The tea comes in a six-pack of tins that are just the right size to insure continued freshness. Speedy shipping too!
4,yes solid white ALBACORE (key word here) buy it now/4lbs 2oz..<br />i could'nt believe my eyes when i saw this..it is like 13.00+ around<br />here where we live..<br />9.66 a can free ship no tax using subscribe and save and the<br />Save 15% when you enter code CHICKNC5 special right now..<br />unheard of pricing with free shipping and no tax<br />you can cancel subsribe and save at any time<br />excellent tasting tuna...for about 15 cents an ounce...<br />give the dog and cat some.<br />they do have the light tuna for less but it is not albacore<br />a real nice super tasty tuna for price
1,"I enjoy sodas and carbonated drinks, but don't drink too many of them because I'm trying to consume healthier things.  I was sent a can of The Switch through the Amazon's vine program to review.<br /><br />The smell is very strong, medicine-like, and somewhat unapproachable.  The taste on the other hand is very sweet, and it does have hints of the kiwi and strawberry flavors.  It's a little too sweet for my liking, but I am the type of person who drinks juice watered down.<br /><br />As far as being a ""healthy alternative to soda"", they do a pretty good job.  There's no HFCS (a big plus), and no artificial colors.  On the other hand, all of the juice in it is ""reconstituted from concentrates"".  The can says it has ""natural flavors"" which I always consider a dubious term to hide behind on items claiming to be ""healthy"".  Also, and 8.3 oz can of ""The Switch"" has 135 calories, while a 8.3 oz of Coke has roughly 109 calories, so this thing is a sugar bomb (even though it says there is ""no sugar added"".  No kidding!  It doesn't need it!).<br /><br />If you like really sweet things, then this might be a good buy for you.  As for myself, I don't think I'd go out of my way to try this again."
0,"I was out to dinner with friends & family at ""The Saloon"" in ""Rte 46 Entertainment Complex"" in Sanford FL. Besides having an awesome staff (ask for Keith) and fabulous food (the escargot is a MUST) they serve China Mist tea. This is the 1st time I chose the Tropical Organic Green -- I have no doubt it is the best flavored tea I have ever had."
1,"Learning that we Americans have an imbalance of omega3 vs. omega6, I was glad to find something to correct the imbalance without putting in too much effort. Chia doesn't taste like anything. Just looks like mini dinosaur eggs! I use two tablespoons of chia in a large cup of water with matcha and a little bit of crystal light. It's fun to drink it when the seeds bloat like tomato seeds!"
4,"In case you're wondering, this is a pate, and not the hunk variety.  That said, I have one cat that will eat this and one that will not.  I've never had a male that will eat a pate, no matter what the variety and this one is no exception.  The female, she just lOVES this stuff.  I mix it with a bit of water and microwave it for about 8 seconds since it's pretty thick in the can. The quality is quite good on this stuff too - almost like Fancy Feast.  It's a bit rich and will fill you cat up quite nicely too.  Great stuff, loved sincerely in this house, highly recommend!"
0,"We switched to tea sometime back.We brew a pot in the morning and if anything is left over my wife has it as ice tea later in the day,so we waste nothing.<br />For me Orange Pekoe rules, it's a matter of personal taste as there is a very wide selection of teas on the market.<br />Brooke Bond has been around for years,you cannot go wrong with any of their products."
2,"My baby LOVES sweet potatoes. I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there... it was horribly runny, like spooning formula into his mouth. Ick."
1,"I have always been a fan of premium beverages and sodas. I will never buy Pepsi or Coke products. At a minimum I will by Jones because they use pure cane sugar. I really enjoyed getting to try this product, and I am actually going on now to start ordering it on a regular basis.<br /><br />You can really tell the difference between ""pop"" and juice with sparkling water. It is a bit on the sweet side, and I did not think they needed to add the extra juice flavors to make it just right. However this is a great product, good size for individual servings, and it arrived in good packaging by amazon."
0,"I like Earl Gray tea, but sometimes, I prefer a more delicate taste.<br />That's where Lady Grey comes in!<br />I can drink it at breakfast, lunch or even in the evening while reading a book/kindle!<br />Invited guests asked what brand the delicious tea is and started ordering as well.<br />Recommended!"
2,"I bought Crunchies Freeze-Dried Organic Peas and some other Crunchies products in hopes they would be a satisfying, healthy snack for my children.  Both of my kids (ages 5 and 8) gave me the thumbs down on taste, though.  Same reaction to the other dried veggies and even the dried fruits. So, my desk at work is now full of Crunchies products, and they are a nice quick snack to keep me going between meals. I recommend them for this purpose, but I think most kids will probably say no to these products given the flavor of the snacks is OK, not great."
3,"This item, though a cute idea, really doesn't live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink. The ""hot chocolate"" part of the title is very disappointing. Of course, I wasn't fully expecting a milk chocolate taste, but I honestly can't even say it tastes remotely like white chocolate...or really any kind of chocolate for that matter.<br /><br />If you're looking for a novelty drink, this is cute, especially for young girls. However, if you're expecting something akin to hot cocoa as it is generally understood to be, I would look elsewhere."
1,"When it comes to low-calorie drinks, I'll usually partake in a flavored water or apple juice. This little can, however, packed some big taste!<br /><br />First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.<br />The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 135 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 34 grams - plus 33 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.<br /><br />Taste: This is a sweet, fruity drink. The sweetness is natural, not artificial, which is a very nice change of pace for those who want to kick soda to the curb. It has the right blend of kiwi, raspberry, strawberry, apple and grape juices - no one overpowers the other. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to ""make the switch"" for two main reasons:<br />(1) The small can size.<br />(2) The large calorie count.<br /><br />For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I'd suggest a 1-liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price."
2,"I tested this one on my twin 10-month old babies and they liked it immediately.  It was their first beef and their first spinach.  I had already given them chicken and they really like it so they are not vegetarians yet anyway.  Mostly I wanted this product for the spinach and the higher iron content.  Somehow they made this particular flavor brand tasty for babies.<br /><br />I like getting these by the case rather than buying them a jar at a time at the store since 2 babies eat so much.  It's good to keep several flavor brands around too I think, to give your baby a variety.  I'm sure I'll get another case when this one is finished.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Finely Ground Beef, Organic Spinach, Organic Garbanzo Bean Flour, Organic Tomato Paste, Organic Whole Durum Wheat Flour. CONTAINS: WHEAT.<br /><br />This has 110 calories, 31% protein, 100% vitamin A, 8% vitamin C, 4% calcium and 4% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
0,"LOVE THIS TEA! COULD NOT FIND ANY MORE ! I FINALLY FOUND HERE ! THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS AVAILABLE!LOVE THE FACT IT IS DECAF!SO I CAN ENJOY IN THE EVENING! TASTES GREAT !ANY TIME OF DAY! HOT OR COLD! ADD CINNAMON! AND MILK,AND SUGAR (OR FOR THOSE WATCHING THEIR SUGAR INTAKE,ADD SPLENDA OR TRUVIA) FOR A CHANGE.TASTES GREAT THAT WAY TOO!WHEN YOU MAKE THIS WAY YOU CAN ADD ICE AND PUT IN BLENDER  AND CALL IT DESERT!"
0,"If you like green tea that brews for 2 minutes max and you do not ""stew"" your tea by just leaving the bag in until the tea is bitter, this is the tea for you! Of course, it can be done that way, but IF you have refined tea taste, then you will like this tea. I, personally, love the taste of a good green tea. I am so glad to find this brand available online. No one sells it in my area."
0,Perhaps just this batch... not a flavorful tea.  A milquetoast quality.  I like a robust tea so this may be my own misunderstanding of how this blend is supposed to taste.  I'm glad I tried it.
3,"Sometimes, I'd rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work. This meets my cocoa craving. I do not need to add sugar - just add water and brew!"
0,This product is the way to go for making your own favorite blend of coffee and loose leaf tea. I use them for tea and found that I can reuse them for two or three cups.
2,"Agree with the reviewers who pointed out this is too watery, acidic, and tomatoe-y. It doesn't taste like beef at all. It's a little sweet from the tomato, not in a good way. I think it's a problem with all Happy Baby foods I've tried--they are all sweet, maybe to appeal to baby's tastes. This works well for the fruits and veggies, but not so much for the meat and chicken. I want my baby to eat savory food too! The texture was not appealing--very mushy with some quinoa globs. Again, where's the meat? I guess I'll stick with the fruit pouches, and make my own baby meats, which my girl loves."
3,"I ordered this specifically b/c they said ""dark chocolate"" so i was hoping for a rich chocolate flavor. They taste very watery, even using the lowest amount of water on the Keurig. The nutritional fact show that it only has 6 grams of sugar - where the normal store bought powder has 22 grams. I didn't like these at all. If you're going for something low sugar, they might be for you!"
0,"The only reason for the 3 stars was the packets the individual teas were in.  I love this tea, I have the ones in the tin on auto delivery.  I was taking a trip, and ordered these so I could take some with me on my trip.  Prior to leaving home I took some out of the box and put them in my suitcase.  I got to the hotel and tried to open the little packages.  Impossible to open the individual packages.  No knife with me, I ended up using a toe nail clipper to open the individual packages of each tea.<br /><br />Hopefully this was just a problem with the first box, but I would not recommend buying this tea in the boxes, go for the cannisters.  If you do buy the boxes have something near by to open each and every packet of tea."
3,"taste nothing like how cocoa should taste, i'll never touch this again, i'll be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck"
4,"This is good cat food, and it came out even less expensive than Iams with the shipping included."
1,"If you are really thirsty this drink will be a welcomed choice, although almost anything would at that point.  However, I did not like this flavor as much as the Switch watermelon strawberry flavor which I found extremely refreshing.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry is also 100% juice. Although the drink is good, it has a strong syrupy berry flavor which reminded me a little bit of the Robitussin cough syrup I dislike. I also didn't taste any kiwi.<br /><br />At 135 calories for an 8.3 fluid ounce can you might want to drink it sparingly."
4,"You know, I was searching the Internet for the words ""temptations"" and ""vomit"" when I came across these reviews.  I was surprised to hear that I'm not the only one who has had problems with this product.  Within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about 40 minutes.  I didn't realize it was the cause until the second time I fed them to her.  It's really bad because it doesn't cause the cat to throw up all at once.  It's like she can just vomit a little at a time and you're forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit ((or locking her in the bathroom (which is horrible))."
4,My 3 cats like the small kibble size and must enjoy the flavor as they pick aroun their old food mixed in to get to this one. I've noticed their fur seems shinier and softer.
3,"This is the best Hot Cocoa I have found so far, BUT I hope I can find better. It's not real chocolately. Wish it were a bit sweeter but on the whole, I would buy it again if I can't find better."
3,The Grove Square Hot Coco K-Cups have a good flavor but I find that the k-cups do not have enough hot coco mix to make that perfect cup. Thus I recommend putting a little less water in order to make each cup just right.
2,"We love this product!  Our baby is 6 months old and we're introducing new foods to her.  So far she has tried the pumpkin, and she can't get enough!!!  She grabs for the spoon!  We love that this product is organic and that use can use breastmilk to mix so your baby gets added nutrients.  It's portable, compact, and you can take it anywhere.  If at a restaurant or away from home, simply warm up your milk and combine.  It's really fantastic!"
1,"This brand is a little hard to find in stores as i don't think it's carried by any of the major supermarket chains. I discovered it at Au Bon Pain and noticed that unlike other brands I've tried, this one is not from concentrate and has nothing added, it's just pure unadultered coconut water, so the quality can't get much better. The other thing i really like about it is that it's a glass container rather than paper or plastic, so the taste is not compromised. These things alone are worth 5 stars to me but there are a couple things I would suggest to make it even better. First, this isn't really pulp the way you would think of it from you experience with fruit juices where there's pulverized, very small, drinkable pieces floating in the liquid; these are chunks of diced coconut that you have to chew up while drinking. To me, this would be fine if they were all the soft flesh you'd expect from a young cocunut but many of the pieces are harder which is unpleasant in a drink. Second, 9.5 ounces doesn't go a long way, I'd like to see it bumped up to at least a 12oz, I'd then feel like I'm getting an adequate amount for my money and it would last longer and quench better."
0,"I have been drinking hibiscus tea off and on since 1984.  When I went to Germany in 1984, my mother told me that it is quite popular there for blood pressure issues, so every day while I was there I drank it.  When I came back to the US I found it and drank it for a number of years.<br /><br />About a year ago my husband's blood pressure became elevated because of health problems he is experieincing.  So, I went to the local co-op and got some hibiscus tea.  Ever since he started drinking it his blood pressure has been in the normal range -- well under 120/80."
0,"Had to get a tea ball for the loose tea.  This is for a true tea afficianado who can appreciate the art of making tea.  Clearly, this tea being organic, the tin being so decorative, and the purchase putatively benefiting a specific tea growing region allows certain tea afficianados to have a mental appreciation for the background of the tea while drinking it.<br />I drink Earl Grey as a pick me up in the afternoon.  This one is comparable in taste to other Earl Greys on the market."
1,"The Switch Orange-Tangerine beverage is a mix of orange and tangerine juices with carbonated water, and, I must say, it tastes AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's similar to soda, but without all the unhealthy artificial ingredients and high-fructose corn syrup. If you find it, buy it!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Had I known this cocoa was sugar-free, I would not have purchased it. I realize that this will not bother some people, but I really don't like the aftertaste of fake sugar.  In the interest of fairness, this did not seem to trouble my nephew!  Just update the description."
4,"These Fancy Feast Variety Packs, which contain twenty-four cans, always ensure that you have a good supply of cat food on hand. I also do not have to waste my time stacking individual cans.  I always have a box of this one, the Gourmet Variety Pack, which is fish and seafood based, on hand. It contains eight cans each of ground ocean whitefish and tuna, salmon and cod, as well as sole and shrimp.<br /><br />I also always have on hand the Fancy Feast Sliced Variety Pack, which contains eight cans each of beef, chicken hearts and livers, and turkey. In addition, I also have a box of the Fancy Feast Grilled Variety Pack on hand, at all times, which contains eight cans each of grilled beef, turkey, and chicken, each in their own savory sauce. My cat, Mamushka,  loves them all."
4,"I bought these for my cat and if I give them to him, he'll eat them, but it's not the type of treat he'll do tricks for or run over to eat. It's a healthier alternative to other treats, but I wouldn't buy them again because my main point of buying treats is to train my cat to do tricks or reward him for good behavior. These treats simply don't entice him enough to really be a treat."
0,"Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor.  The aroma is sweet spearmint.  The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it.  Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon.  The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion.  Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box.  A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee.  Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter.  Four minutes is ample."
2,"Do you really want to be feeding your baby a bottle of corn syrup???<br />i used this until i realized that. i switched to gerber, its so much better for your baby."
4,"It stinks, it's sticky-gooey-awful, and my cat loves it!<br /><br />My vet recommended ""baby food"" for my cat when he was having trouble digesting his normal fare.  I tried several varieties but Gerber Beef & Gravy was the clear winner.  My cat likes it so much that he insists on a jar of it to start each day.<br /><br />More expensive than ""cat food"", it beats the heck out of having to deal with kitty vomit!  Since Gerber doesn't vitaminize its foods for cats, I add 50-100mg of Taurine to every plate.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are the best!"
3,"You can taste the quality and care that goes into these chocolates. Great flavor, I highly recommend it. You have to try for yourself!"
0,"I am in love with everything rose. I wear rose lotion ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000087L6T"">Rose Milk Skin Care Lotion - 8 fl oz</a>), I burn rose candles (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00069ZDJS"">Yankee Candle Large 22-Ounce Jar Candle, Fresh Cut Roses</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OEWDH6"">Votivo Aromatic Candle Rush Of Rose</a>), I use rose lip balm (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049XKXRY"">Rose Love Balm (Limited Edition) - 15ml/0.5oz</a>) and I drink rose tea (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017SZTRI"">Teas' Tea Rose Green Unsweetened Tea, 16.9-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>.) I seriously surround myself with anything rosy!<br /><br />So when I saw this, *rose preserves*, literally preserves made with real rose petals, I couldn't wait to try it. Oh, the wait was incredible! When it finally arrived I didn't even wait for the toaster, I grabbed a spoon and dug right in!<br /><br />It's delicious. Divine. Extraordinary. It feels absolutely indulgent, eating a jam made of roses. It's so romantic and positively Victorian. There couldn't be a daintier dollop for your scones at tea time.<br /><br />So far I've had rose preserves on waffles, toast, ice cream, fresh fruit & yogurt, and coffee cake. I daresay it would even make a unique sweetener for hot tea.<br /><br />Speaking of sweet, that is my one issue. I find these preserves to be really much sweeter than I generally like; I prefer a bit more tartness, even in jams. Don't get me wrong: it's not overpoweringly sweet, there *is* a definite rose flavor in this, and definitely real petals adding unique flavor and texture. I just wish it weren't quite so sweet. But apparently, according to another reviewer who has tried other brands, Kafkas Rose Preserves are the *least* sugary! Any bit sweeter and it would definitely overpower the delicate rose flavor.<br /><br />So, while I can't give it a full 5 stars because I think it's too sweet -  and by the way I sure wish I could only deduct a half star -  I acknowledge that Kafkas Rose Preserves might be the best available. I certainly won't stop putting it on everything and yes, occasionally enjoying a tiny spoonful!<br /><br />I'm going to host a little tea party for my two little nieces and our American Girls dolls (My <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010XH10I"">American Girl Samantha Doll & Paperback Book</a>, Joelle's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZHY3H4"">American Girl Julie Doll and Paperback Book</a>, and Lisey's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BZYZAO"">American Girl Kit Kittredge Doll & Paperback Book</a>) and I know the girls will get a kick out of eating jam made of flower petals! I'm also looking forward to my extended family's next brunch, because I will be proudly serving up some rose preserves. In fact, I may be giving out Kafkas Rose Preserves as hostess gifts in lieu of the boring bottles of moscato or prosecco I'm forever dragging to parties. This would be promptly opened and enjoyed, I'm sure of it!<br /><br />If you're a rose lover, or looking for a unique gift, perhaps a cute and clever new spin on ""a bouquet of roses and a box of candy"", I highly recommend these rose preserves!"
2,"We first tried this because our toddler went through a picky-eater phase. She loved these! They are crunchy and small enough for her to pick up. I love them because they are organic and a veggie that she actually asks for. I mainly give them to her right out the package but I've also mixed them into scrambled eggs, which she really likes too."
1,"I believe the label that says this soda is all-natural. But it has a sweet, candy-like taste. Not for everyone.<br /><br />I did enjoy this drink. I believe that the size (8.3 ounce) is too small for a sit-down meal. It is otherwise a good size. A drink this sweet, I would not like to fill up on."
0,I really love this tea and have found that my daughter and daughter-in-law feel the same!  I've used the loose leaf tea for years but find the convenience of the bags encouraging.
4,My kitties love these. Other Goodlife treats are good. Kitties adore these. Beg and plead for them. I think they must be addictive for cats.
2,"My daughter thinks this tastes nasty, and I agree. She is sensitive to carrot, so I was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but doesn't contain carrot. Though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time, she wouldn't even take a full bite of this. I tasted a little bit, and I can see why."
0,"I had high hopes when I ordered this tea, as years ago in San Francisco I used to buy a lovely rose black in Chinatown which was my favorite tea ever. Unfortunately, this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine. I prefer the opposite, a full-bodied tea I can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof.  But for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch, this might be a good choice."
0,"I don't know which herb is so tasty in here.. but it's a great combination.  I don't like licorice flavors, and this tea is great because I can reap the great benefits of licorice root, without tasting it!<br /><br />It really does help my symptoms, and drinking it for prevention has worked great for me as well.  And you cannot beat the shipping price (free with super saver shipping) with Amazon."
1,"I'm not a fan of fruit flavored sodas, usually I find them to be too sweet. Thankfully this wasn't overly sweet, but I still don't think it's something I would drink on a regular basis. I tend to prefer my fruit drinks to just be the fruit juice. I don't need the added carbonation added to the drink."
0,"This tea is simply amazing!  It definitely has a very exotic flavor and has a very very good taste and especially the after taste is the best!  When you drink the tea, you can feel the sensations of the licorice and mint and it taste incredible!  A must drink!"
3,This is the 3rd brand of Mexican Spiced hot cocoa that I've ordered.  This by far is the poorest in tasting.  The other 2 were far superior in flavor.
4,"My cats love this cat food! It is so much easier for them to eat as it is so much easier for them to chew. I have older cats and this is so much better for them. I can't get the larger bags of food at the local feed stores, so I order from Amazon, as I have 3 cats."
2,"My daughter loved this because it was chunkier than the Earth's Best stage 3 foods.  The only thing is that while Earth's Best is cheaper through Amazon Mom, this is actually cheaper through Fresh Direct, so we get our through them."
1,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
2,"These wonderful fruits are of a consistency somewhere between apple sauce and baby food. I found this particular flavor to be exactly like the little cinnamon and applesauce cups that I often have at home.<br /><br />While these are more expensive (even in the store) than the little fruit cups, they have a perfect use ... Traveling!  As any parent with a child knows, kids, spoons, and  liquids are not a good mix. Spills happen!  Since these include only fruit, juice, and natural flavorings, they make a nice snack without added sugar.<br /><br />However, having recently made an extended trip by myself, I discovered they are wonderful in a different way. They make a great boost for the driver as well. And they aren't half bad, even when warm! I am a diabetic, so the 15 grams of carb are a perfect complement to my needs for a snack. I kept a couple next to me, and they were perfect when my blood sugar was dropping and the next rest stop was far away. My only problem using them this way involved getting the lids off!"
2,"I thought this sounded like the perfect solution for taking nutritious wholesome food with us for our 8 month old baby on our vacation out of the country where I am worried we won't have very many fruit and vegetable options.  I have been making my own baby food with organic ingredients for the last 2 months.  I was excited to get the package today and ripped open the sweet potatoes, one of my daughter's homemade favorites.  I was extremely disgusted by the smell of the powder but decided to put some water in and give it a try anyway (hoping that the hydration would somehow help the mixture).  I tried a bite and these don't even taste anything like sweet potatoes.  They are very dark brown and tasted like minerals and quite unnatural.  My daughter ate the two bites I gave her but I felt too guilty feeding her anymore and dumped out the bowl...and my garbage smells terrible now."
0,"Somehow I missed the word spice. I wanted Peach tea, but this is black tea with clove and orange peel flavoring.  I wanted to get off of black tea as it  can cause low hemoglobin which is not good for folks who want to donate blood regularly.  Unfortunately, although this is advertised as peach, it is just black tea."
0,I don't usually drink tea but I love this one. I thought the shipping price was a little high but love the tea so much that I had to get it. Perfect with a little bit of Honey.
0,"I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And I'm glad I did. It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma. It has a nice reddish color. This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I've had, and I look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that I've read about."
2,My twin boys both love this food.  It has the best texture of any of the HAPPYBABY meats we've tried.  The pieces of chicken and pasta aren't too big either.  This is great for babies resistant to texture--It has some but not too much!
3,"Not bad at all when I use CoffeeMate CHOCOLATE creamer.<br />I still like swiss mix made with 2% milk a little better.<br />But as far K-Cups go, this milk chocolate with the Coffeemate Chocolate Creamer is not bad.<br />And currently, it is less than $11.00 for 24 cups."
2,"My triplets will not eat this, eventhe one who will eat ANYTHING. The consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon."
4,"I have several very, very finicky cats and they ALL are absolutely crazy for these Butler Tartar Control treats !  The best part (to me) is that these are healthy treats, as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for any cat ""parent"" !!"
4,"This food has worked fairly well for my two not quite senior feral rescues, one of whom has CRF and one of whom has IBD (eating pigeons and food left on the ground apparently isn't so good for young kitties' digestive systems and other internal organs, I guess).  It is a lower protein and phosphorus food, but the first ingredient is real chicken (unlike some renal foods that are made with mostly by-products).  It also doesn't cost an arm and a leg, compared to other special foods, and my CRF kitty, who often rejects a perfectly delicious food once she has tasted it in reverse, has been willing to keep eating this even though she's been sick on it more than once."
0,I just received my tea..  Thanks for getting it out so quick.. I really appreciate the extra box..  I drink this tea every night..<br /><br />Julianne
1,"A soft drink does seem like a trivial item to review especially since the general category of food and beverages depends more on one's own palate. A friend of mine introduced me to this drink based on his own childhood remembrance in the Midwest. I don't recall it from mine, but once I tasted it, it did take me back to the days when miniature plastic bottles of Hawaiian Fruit Punch stood next to my mother's jell-o mold in the refrigerator.<br /><br />With the appropriate color-clashing, tropical d&eacute;cor on the can, Tahitian Treat is tasty in that fizzy, retro sort of way and is definitely not for the macrobiotic among us, as there are standard, life-shortening ingredients like sodium benzoate and Red #40 pervading the carbonation. And you certainly can't drink it like Diet Coke since it is an astonishing 200 calories a can. But baby boomers should have a stash when they feel like a walk down a sugar-infested memory lane. Be forewarned that Amazon may be the only option to get this soft drink since it is not easily found at stores as specialized as Beverages and More, at least here in Northern California."
3,"I ordered this wanting to try a hot chocolate on my Keurig, and I am very happy with this product. I will definitely be ordering it again. That being said, I dislike hot chocolate made completely of water, so I do add a splash of Half and Half to my cup when I make this. Thus, I didn't want to give it a 5 star rating since I do doctor my cup up a bit at home (otherwise I would have). However, I won't even venture to make a cup of hot chocolate in a packet from the grocery store with water, I use 100% milk usually for those and they still don't measure up to this product from Grove Square. So, the fact that this tastes so good made with water and a bit of creamer to me speaks volumes. I do have to say that this is by far the best cup of instant cocoa that I have ever tried at home. Compared to the Swiss Miss in the cupboard this had a distinctly grown up taste to it. I'm a big fan!"
1,"This is a sweet, mild flavored and lightly carbonated juice mix which is dominated by the flavor of apple juice and white grape juice. These probably  make up at least 80 to 90% of this juice by volume. The juice is a pleasant mild red or pink blush color. The mild kiwi and berry flavor appears almost as a pleasant aftertaste rather than the dominant flavor note.<br /><br />If you enjoy a juice which is sweet without much tartness and with a low level of carbonation this has a pleasant but not outstanding flavor. I personally prefer stronger flavors and more carbonation.  Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion (""No Sugar Added"" and ""No Preservatives"") is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice. The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit. Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you."
0,"Sent very prompty, tea is delicious, will continue to use this company with great enthusiasm."
2,Feel like a protein boost?  Got the nibbles?  Don't want to succumb to potato chips?  Here's a great alternative!  Just don't let your toddler try to open the package or your peas will be all over the floor making  for an expensive snack for the dog and a grumpy mommy.
0,"This is a wonderful English Breakfast tea- nicely flavorful without being either too bold or too bland. Makes a wonderful morning tea without any sort of bitterness or tang-y taste to it. It's a nice comfort tea and a good start to loose teas for anyone who has been using bags and doesn't know which flavor loose teas to start with.<br /><br />I recommend brewing as follows: 2 teaspoons to 12-16 ounces of boiling water for 3.5 minutes. If you overbrew (particularly Adagio's teas), there's a chance for bitterness, so I would not recommend leaving it in the water for a long time.<br /><br />Another recommendation is Adagio's Irish Breakfast (which I slightly prefer) but both teas are standouts!"
2,We love this brand of freeze dried fruit and veggies.  They make it easy to have healthy on the go snacks for our 2 year old!
0,"Great tasty way to start your day yet shrinking your fat cells. I don't think I would need any other tea after this one. I have tried other Pu Erh teas, but this is the best tasting one. Again I am not a coffee drinker, but always started my day with black tea, may be being raised in Europe had its effect on my taste. After knowing about Pu Erh tea in Dr. Oz show for fat shrinking quality, I tried different brands and found out this one is the best."
3,"I ordered this for my birthday. I got birthday money from family, and I ordered a couple of goodies, perfume, and this cocoa.  I love hot chocolate, and I'm always looking for new ones to try.  Based on the first review I decided to go ahead and order.  I will probably not reorder.  Mixed by itself into hot water it seems to lack thickness.  It also has too much of an artificial raspberry taste.  I like Hershey's Bliss Raspberry Chocolate much better.  I've been adding one spoonful of the Cobblestone Kitchen to my regular cocoa to give it a raspberry boost.  But, by itself, it does not stand up to the test. I plan on finishing the three remaining cans over time by using it as a stir in additive to other cocoa."
4,"I've tried a number of high-quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them, and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats.  For one thing, these actually look like fish.  You open the can, and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can, instead of the weird, mystery paste.  It pretty much smells like you've opened a can of real fish, too (not in a bad way, though I don't share my cats' love of sardines.)<br /><br />One of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food.  I picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when I wanted to try switching to Tiki Cat, and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines.  There are a few different sardine varieties, so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them.<br /><br />The picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food, but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to Tiki Cat, so I take that as her endorsement of this positive review."
3,"I bought this mostly because i wanted the peppermint hot cocoa, but i fell in love with the milk chocolate one.  The peppermint was pretty good as well...good cocoa!!!"
4,"great bargain, cats love it, ad do well on it  and normally I have problems with them upchucking after eating,  they have not with this, yet.  the kibble is a bit large but I soak it in water anyhow, so it is just fine.  K Campbell"
0,One of my favorite teas!  Shipping was great and very fast!  I could drink this tea all day long...And to think it is also so good for you.  Too  bad it is not available at nearby stores.
2,"Do not buy product contain gelatin. Gelatin in baby food ??? Why gerber ???, Do not buy if you follow vegetarian or kosher/Halal regime."
3,"I love this stuff. It's not your regular milk chocolate hot cocoa, but if you like trying different flavors of cocoa, you should give this a try.  To me it tastes like dark chocolate and isn't as sweet as the regular stuff. But it has a great taste and it's actually good for you. Highly recomend it."
4,"I want to give my cats as much variety as possible. They are family and they matter. Variety makes them happy. And their health & wellbeing are important. Giving them good, healthy food and treats are apart of showing them how loved they are. Unfortunately, I have to go online to find some treats as the stores don't carry the variety any more."
3,"...but you'd better like sweet. This is not for those who want dark or semi-sweet chocolate. For those of us who like sweet, this is decadent . It is worth the $! Go for it!!!"
0,You know I really do love this product. I wish I could give the tea 5 stars because it really does brew up a very pleasant tasting iced tea that needs little sugar or other embellishments. The problem is it's loose and when you  are trying to make a big jug of it with two packets of tea it is a huge mess to strain. And ordinary double mesh strainer is not fine enough. I don't have coffee strainers in the house so I had to line a mess strainer with paper towels and it took forever to strain. But when I strained it with just my mesh strainer there was a ton of tea in the jug. I wish the variety pack came pre-bagged like the smaller boxes of tea do.
2,"Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes. This one is more watery than the others, so keep that in mind. Reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different, so I hope letting you know the consistency and texture help."
3,"I've tried all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the Keurig, and this is the only one I keep buying more of when I run out. Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some."
3,Not too sweet.  The best K-cup hot chocolate I've tried thus far. The kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate.
0,"Earl Grey Tea can be overwhelming. Generally, when an Earl Grey calls itself ""Bold"", they aren't joking. Personally, if there is too much bergamot oil in the tea, it is too overpowering for me to drink. I like to drink an aromatic tea, not a cup of perfume. The Rishi Earl Grey tea is described as ""bold and sweetly smooth with an enlivening aroma of bergamot citrus."" I think that sums it up very well. I was a little concerned when I popped the lid on the tin, as the scent was very powerful.  However, it is a pleasant smelling tea that does not overwhelm me when the cup reaches the mouth. I can taste a high quality, rich black tea with sweet and lightly citrus tones.<br /><br />I also feel good about drinking this tea because it is a Fair Trade Certified tea that is shade grown from heirloom tea trees. It's organic as well as Kosher. Rishi also says this tea can be steeped multiple times, so this tea is also very economical. I'll definitely be trying more Rishi teas."
3,Found this product discounted at a good price at slickdeals.net for about $10.<br /><br />First time drinking this stuff since I bought it.  I was blown away at how awesome it taste.  This was my first time trying something other than the Nestle brand cocoa (other than the few times I ordered cocoa at a cafe).<br /><br />Has a nice blend of mocoa/cocoa and doesn't taste too sweet like what I'm used to with Nestle.<br /><br />Definitely giving this a thumbs up.
0,I love this tea!!  I drink it every day of the year.  My grandma made her tea from this and its the only tea my family drinks!!
0,"This Twinings tea is a simple pleasure that never offends. It is sturdy enough to be enjoyed with milk or sweetener, yet has little harshness when consumed black.<br /><br />Twinings of London was founded in 1706, and is known internationally for marketing teas of consistency and value. Twinings English Breakfast Tea was originally blended to complement the traditional, hearty English Breakfast, from which its name derives. Twinings literature tells us that this is a blend of Kenyan and Assam black teas.<br /><br />Tea enthusiasts generally prefer loose tea to tea bags which contain less expensive, smaller particles and the ""fannings"" or ""dust"" remains from processing of loose leaf tea. Moreover, you can sometimes taste the paper used in bags, especially in the weaker teas.<br /><br />However, this Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses only small particles that infuse more quickly than whole leaves. This blend approaches full strength within just a couple minutes. To avoid excessive particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />This product is a fine introduction to the world of loose tea. Would I rank it as my favorite tea or even my favorite Twinings? No, but I keep some available for when I want the pleasure of plain ol' tea. (As an aside, I would rank Twinings' Earl Grey a bit higher in quality. It is a whole leaf tea with just the right amount of bergamot orange flavoring. I don't think of it as an everyday tea, but I enjoy it as an occasional pleasure.)"
1,"Gatorade G2 is the way to go when you want the benefits of Gatorade without quite so much sugar. As I am in a ""pre-diabetes"" state these days, I am drinking this type of Gatorade instead of the regular Gatorade which has noticeably more sugar in it. The really good thing is that this still replenishes carbs and electrolytes after I exercise without putting unnecessary extra sugar into my system.<br /><br />G2 comes in flavors including fruit punch and grape.<br /><br />If you're on the go, the advantage of these bottles of Gatorade is this: because the bottles are smaller you can carry them with you much easier than if you took the regular, larger size bottles of Gatorade G2.<br /><br />I highly recommend this drink if you need extra carbs or electrolytes after exercising; it replenishes them very well without the extra sugar found in regular Gatorade."
0,"Take the warm scent of Italian Bergamot and blend it with natural raspberry flavor and swirl it into South Indian black tea and what you are creating is a raspberry dream of a tea. This tea, if made with powdered milk, honey or a packet of stevia becomes creamy.<br /><br />Top with vanilla whipped cream and you have a vanilla raspberry bergamot tea. This is the perfect for tea parties or sipping in the morning while enjoying a raspberry muffin.<br /><br />The people who pick the tea leaves are paid a fair wage and the positive energy really does come through in the flavor of the tea. The tea leaves are also organic.<br /><br />I think this is the most delicious tea I've ever tasted! Once you try this flavor, you will want to try all the flavors. I also love the Fireside Chai.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
3,"I've been excitedly trying every type of K cup I can get my hands on since I got my Keurig for christmas and, until now, have not encountered any that I truly hate. Until I discovered this one. I would have though it pretty difficult to ruin hot chocolate but the people at Grove Square certainly did a good job. Not only was the hot chocolate watery, but it had a horrible plastic aftertaste also. Yuck!"
4,"My 12 year old cat loves this food and seems to be shedding less since switching to this food.  All of my cats are on Royal Canin products, it's a high quality brand."
0,This was bought to be used in our wedding and we couldn't be happier. We have a ton of tea left over and we have been enjoying it. The flavor is good and doesn't taste as though it has been sitting in the boxes for a long time. Twinings is a great company and we have often had their tea in the past and we will probably continue to get it in the future. The box of 6 is a great way to get the bulk you need without paying a ton.
0,"It's not great plain, but it's wonderful mixed with other herbs.  It can be a little bland if you don't put anything but the rosehips in the infuser.  Hibiscus goes great with it, though.  It's a great tea for children because it's mild and fruity, for adults add it to something else.<br />Also, you can eat the rosehips after they've been brewed, sounds weird but they are great, they taste a little bit like an apple and have lots of vitamin C.  Watch out for the pith (that's the best word I can think of for the little hairlike thorns that surround the seeds), though, if you decide to eat the hips.  Every once in a while you find one that hasn't been de-pithed properly, hence you need to avoid the pith if you eat the brewed hips."
1,"The can size is like a Redbull drink's.  However, its sugar content is 34 grams.  Attached is a photo of the nutrional facts.<br /><br />In terms of its taste, in my opinion, it's quite tasty, sweet, a bit tangy and very orangish!"
1,My 7 year old daughter thought it was good tasted like pop but only drank 1/2 of the can. I thought it tasted like watered down orange soda with very little fizz with funny after taste. It is suppose to be  100% juice with vitamin C that has been carbonated. Ok here is my thought either buy 100% orange juice that taste like it came right of the tree or buy a orange pop. For me this product won't be flying off the shelves.
2,"When I found out I was pregnant with my first child, I read in a baby magazine about the wonderful health benefits of Chia seeds. They are packed with Omega-3 fatty acids, and because healthy brain function is nurtured by Omega-3 fatty acids, I wanted to supplement my diet with something other than fish oil pills that can pack a fairly unpleasant aftertaste.<br />These seeds are so tiny, and so flavorless, that you can mix them into cereal, or even juice, without ever realizing you have consumed them. I have also found that adding these seeds to my breakfast keeps me fuller longer.<br />Chia seeds are more convenient than flax seeds, and a pound of them, costing around $12 (depending on the seller), lasts a few months.<br />If you want to avoid the potential unpleasantness of fish oil supplements, Chia seeds are a great alternative, and for new or expecting mothers, they are a great way to ensure your baby is getting what s/he needs for optimum brain health and development.<br />Lastly, you do not have to be considering motherhood to consider adding Chia to your diet. It is a wonderful, all-natural supplement that is perfectly painless (in both taste and cost) to undertake.<br /> Who would have thought that the seeds responsible for the (infamous) ""Chia Pet"" would offer so much more than a gawdy table ornament?<br />Highly recommended."
3,These are very good tasting and very fast making drinks.  The convene e of having a cup of hot chocolate in seconds and have it taste good is such a plus.
4,"One of my cats has had a chronic constipation problem most of her life.  The Friskies Indoor Selects Classic Chicken Entree is her favorite flavor of all.  Since this has brown rice and spinach as some of the ingredients it has helped keep Stinky a little more ""regular"".  My vet believes all cats should get *some* wet food per day - he gave his approval on this brand over some of the others, even though it's a grocery store brand.  Occasionally I still have to help her along with an 1/8 tsp. of Miralax mixed into this, but she doesn't even notice the Miralax, she still laps this up and begs for more."
1,"I wanted something easy, tasty , and healthy to sub for my diet soda addiction. This did the trick. I drank it for 10 days without adding any sweetener. Once you get past the color, which is a nasty green, the tea is tasty. About a half tsp of sugar really adds to the taste. I will buy this again!"
0,"I can't find this tea in any store, so every few months I get another order of it on Amazon.  Just delicious, sweet tasting tea.  Whenever I make a cup for someone to try, they are shocked at how sweet it is, and with no sugar added!  I love love love it."
2,I was a bit disappointed in these.  They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture.  My son (6) does not like them.
1,"The Switch Orange Tangerine is a nice beverage that is lightly carbonated and is made with real fruit juice.  Unlike most sodas, The Switch products are made with real ingredients (none of the High fructose corn Syrup) and it tastes great.  The cans come in a convenient 8.5 ounce can and they're great for lunch or an mid afternoon treat,  If you want a light beverage that's made with the ""good stuff"" then you'll want to grab a can of The Switch.  Do yourself a favor throw out the HFCS sodas and make ""The Switch""."
1,"You know what one of my favorite sounds is? The sound of a can opening. I think it's weird, consider I'm not a huge soda drinker...since I find most sodas too be way too sweet or sugary.<br /><br />This is a review for an Orange Tangerine drink from Switch. I've never heard of them, but I was feeling kind of thirsty so I ordered a can from the vine program. It's an 8.3 ounce can of 100% carbonated juice (plus gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascborbic acid and soy). I don't know what to think about some of the ingredients, but I certainly do know that I like: that it's only 8 ounces and that it has no corn syrup!<br /><br />It tastes very similar to canned Minute Maid drinks, especially the Vallencia Orange offering...but does have a slightly sickly sweet aftertaste.  I don't know if I'd run out and buy a 24 pack, but if I saw this in a restaurant I'd definitely consider it as a tasty complement to a sandwich and potato chip lunch.<br /><br />The last thing I like is about the company: it seems to be an independently owned shop, and I like that."
1,"I'm not that into pop/soda ect, but I'm glad I tried this Kiwi Berry. It isnt very carbonated, not too sweet and has no preservatives. I will add I love strawberries/kiwi's so I enjoyed the fruity taste. It has allot of calories for such a small bottle...all in all I like this and will probably try it again."
0,"I love this tea.  I am a long-time tea drinker, and purchased tea bags for longer than I want to count (or think about).  A couple of years ago I decided to go for it...make loose tea, and deal with mess of leaves.  And yes, I did know about strainers and tea balls, but I live in no man-s land.  If it isn't prepackaged, it's unfit to ingest according to the natives.  Good utensils are hard to find.<br /><br />I finally found a wonderful BIG mesh tea ball.  Ahhh, a tea drinker's best friend, right after a good English teapot.<br /><br />The mesh ball in question is like the one sold here as a rule, by the way.<br /><br />Tea is now a breeze to make, and absolutely delicious.<br /><br /> The loose packaged tea put out by Lipton is wonderful.  It has a beautiful taste, unlike their teabags, which can be very iffy.  I've had some that tasted like floor sweepings.<br /><br />This loose tea seems amazingly consistent in flavor.  I recommend it without reservation. And isn't Amazon just lovely...?  They'll bring it right to your door.  How much more could you ask?<br /><br />Earlier I mentioned an English teapot.  I favor Sadler's because of the excellent glaze, and the good material they use in the functional brown teapots they make.<br /><br />A good teapot matters.  Get yourself one, a nice tea ball, and some Lipton Loose tea and you will likely never use teabags again.  If the tea is too strong, do it the way it's done in England; keep a very lightly boiling kettle going, and dilute with boiling water to your taste."
0,I love this organic fair trade tea and used to buy it at Whole Foods. When I found it on Amazon I was delighted! Now I can buy 3 at a time and it's like getting the third one free!
3,"I love hot chocolate, but I found this mix repulsive. There wasn't a strong chocolate flavor and the other flavor notes where far too sweet.  I had to throw it away. I will never purchase this again."
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry carbonated fruit juice tasted good, but it was too sweet and had too many calories for my liking. I could drink a regular can of soda. Going forward, I probably would not buy this beverage because I do not like to drink that many calories (135) or sugar (33 grams) in one sitting."
3,"Wow, I did a lot of reading trying to make a good decision on a K-cup hot chocolate, and of course taste is something that is very subjective.  If you read all the reviews on every product you'll discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation.  So I decided that even with some bad reviews I'd try this one since it has a lot of good reviews.  I'm just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread.  Some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute, or some such thing.  All I can tell you is I must have under-achieving taste buds because all I can taste is yummy hot chocolate.  My family burned through the first box and I just ordered two more.  If you don't like this I feel sorry for you. Better to have numb taste buds I guess.  Enjoy."
1,"First off, there is a difference when you drink something out of box versus glass. A big difference.<br /><br />I was strolling in my local health food store and saw that this product was being packaged in a bottle. I snatched that sucker off the shelf faster than you could blink.<br /><br />I had tried this brand visiting a bigger city over a year ago. Only to find out when I got home that they didn't sell the canned version at my store. I was so bummed but not up for ordering cases of this stuff online.<br /><br />I have tried the other brands. This is by far the best. It could be because it's in a glass. I'm not a high end taste tester but I just know there is a big difference. And this stuff is like wine...best served when chilled. So being in a glass bottle makes all the difference in the world. Guess you could make that analogy of boxed wined versus bottled. I'll always take bottle over boxed even if the box is more bang for your buck. I'm a foodie. I love savoring food and beverage.<br /><br />A lot of people are mentioning it's over priced. Compared to what? And if you notice it's not Amazon selling it, it's a distributor using Amazon as a portal to advertise and sell it. The free shipping is really put into the cost of the price of a case. They could reduce the price but then it would probably say $10-$15.00 for shipping. It really would not make a difference.<br /><br />But I'm happy it's at my local health food store. I'm not ready to buy this by the case. Woohoo. Thanks, Taste Nirvana. This really is ""Happiness in a bottle."" Go get your own. I'm not sharing ;)"
1,"I used to drink Crystal Light over 10 years ago.  The choices were minimal:  Tea, tea with lemon, lemonade and pink lemonade.  At my job we have an area set up so employees can buy snacks and this variety pack.  Tired of soda, I opted to try the Crystal Light On the Go Wild Strawberry-Energy.  I instantly LOVED it.  This is coming from a person who really doesn't care for strawberries.<br /><br />Unlike another poster I didn't find it too strong.  I DO find the Cherry Pomegranate a tad powerful, but still yummy.  The last two-lemonade and raspberry lemonade- are also delicious.<br /><br />Having tried the Wild Strawberry at work I thought I'd see if Amazon had it and it did.  While I know purchasing an item this way is more expensive per serving, I prefer it this way.  When I make a pitcher of a drink I tend to get tired of it and it ends up going down the drain.  Now THAT is a waste of money!<br /><br />If you like Crystal Light then I'm pretty sure you'll like these flavors.  None of them are my favorite (I prefer fruit punch and pink lemonade) but I really like this product."
4,"I adopted a mature stray this year.  He was a great cat, but scruffy, and his bowel movements were absolutely toxic.  I was feeding him Purina One, but on the vet's recommendation we switched to Royal Canin, and the difference in the cat is amazing.  His coat is thick and soft, he no longer sheds, his dandruff is gone, and we don't need gas masks to clean his litter box.  I would never have believed that a change in food could make so much difference, but it did.  Great stuff."
0,"I normally hate, hate, hate citrus anything in my tea.  I always thought it tasted the way lemon dish soap smells.  I received this tea in a sampler and wow, I can't get enough of it.  It's the first citrus flavored tea I've ever liked in my life.  It smells really good, sorta like Froot Loops, and I didn't even need to put any sugar or honey in it to enjoy it."
0,There was not as much flavor as I remembered from my previous purchase of this tea at the local grocery store.  Could not get it locally anymore and am wondering if product was discontinued and this was old merchandise.
0,"*****<br /><br />Sweet African Green Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a delectable Numi tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and kosher and contains only green rooibos and honeybush. It is from South Africa, made from the same plant as Rooibos (Red Tea), but it is not sun-dried, and it has more anti-oxidants than green tea. It is also rich in phytoestrogens. It has a light, smooth, eathy-woody taste.<br /><br />If you like Numi herbal teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you just want a tasty, high-quality rooibos tea, this one does not disappoint.<br /><br />*****"
0,"As others have said, Lipton's Loose Tea is very difficult<br />to find in stores.  I prefer the loose tea to the tea<br />bags for iced tea.  I hope Amazon continues to offer the<br />Loose Tea as I try and stock up when I can."
0,"lots of uses for this green tea...<br /><br />I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...<br /><br />Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...<br />from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...<br /><br />To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.<br /><br />I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....<br />in the ground form known as matcha.<br />A quality product. Dissolves well.<br /><br />I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened."
4,This is one of the few products my spoiled brats really appreciate. I look for bargains and sometimes I find cheaper elsewhere. This product is from petfooddirect.com and often they offer coupons through email. My kitties only like the elegant medleys and basically refuse all else and they only like a few of these too. I am stuck spending all my dough to feed the felines. Oh well ...
0,"I am not usually an huge fan of Earl Grey, I tend to like  milder flavors but this one knocked me over. The aroma is wonderful and the tin is packed to the top.. not 3/4 full like some tea's I have purchased<br />  This is one that is going to be reordered in this house, we all liked it that much.<br />I served this to  a friend who is an avid Tea drinker  ( only the best tea's for her) and she was raving about it and took the name to order for herself.<br />That said it all for me."
2,My son loves Earth's best baby food. He enjoys his vegetables as much as he does with his fruits. He has no problem digesting his food and never spits it up.
0,"This is best loose green tea I have yet tried.<br /><br />I boil H20 seperately in office microwave => then pour into my personal heat treated glass cup with stainless infuser, then watch gunpowder leaves unfurl!<br /><br />Twinings delivers high quality product, consistent for color, taste, and packaging."
0,"I've bought the Lady Grey teabags for years and enjoyed them...However, the loose tea is even better!!!  It is not as harsh as the Earl Grey but with a more subtle citrus flavor.  This has been a favorite of mine for years and hopefully for years to come.  (Twinings--please don't ever discontinue this flavor...It is superb!)"
0,"This is a wonderful warm flavored tea, especially now in colder weather.<br />This tea has a sweet,soothing chamomile fragrance. It is subtle and sweet.It's one of the better chamomile teas.<br />If you find it hard to sleep at times, a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help.<br />If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea.<br />I highly recommend both."
0,"I love strong, full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam, irish breakfast or early grey tea, but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging. So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasn't bitter at a more palatable price point, and this certainly fits the bill. And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another, i.e. iced vs. hot, this tea is excellent in both forms. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesn't cost an arm and leg."
1,"I found this soda simultaneously sweet and tart, which is interesting, with no bitter aftertaste or the acidic feeling of regular dark soda. It was a bit too sweet for me, and I couldn't taste the kiwi nor was I wowed over by the taste of fresh strawberries. In fact, it was not that much different than Hanson's (although I like their taste better). It's 100% juice and carbonated - I figured it would either taste like sparkling cider or something similar orange soda, but neither is correct. It seems a bit heavier than cider and not as bubbly as orange soda. It does not really have a fresh fruit taste to it, and it is a bit heavy on the taste (e.g. not a subtle, light taste).<br /><br />Being 100% juice this could be a better choice than soda for kids. But with 135 calories and 11% of your RDA of sugar in a small 8 oz can, you are only improving over the dyes and additives. If the sugars concern you, compare this to Soda Club's drinks and you will be much happier there. However, it does sport 100% of RDA of Vitamin C - so it might have a slight cold-fighting benefit as well. For an adult, I would pass. The soda is sized for kids and that also means more waste generated. It would be too easy to chug 4 of these, and while being fat free, it is not easy on the calories.<br /><br />Bottom line: I like it but don't love it; however it was too small, had too many calories, and is too pricey for everyday consumption."
0,but this tea taste wonderful!  I would buy it for the taste alone.  It can also be purchased at Wild By Nature.
1,"While I didn't like this flavor as well as the black cherry, it was still quite good.  Had a nice fruity taste and not overly sweet, probably because there is no added sugar.  You won't miss the sugar and neither will your kids.  This is a good alternative to regular soda for the kids because it doesn't have all the additives that soda does.  It's basically carbonated fruit juice.  It's 100% juice, so you get a nice dose of Vitamin C (100% daily allowance according to the can).  Adults will enjoy it too.  The can is 8.3 oz., which is smaller than a 12-oz soft drink, but it is just enough to satisfy your soda craving, without filling you or your kids up too much.  Sugar is sugar whether naturally occurring in juice or added, so these are not health drinks, but are great alternatives to the much more sugar and additive laden sodas."
1,This drink had a really good flavor.  I not to sweet or too strong.  A really good refreshing beverage that i would buy again.
1,"This little can holds big flavor.  Fruit juice, V-C and fizzy stuff, is a good way to describe it.<br /><br />My kids love it and their school's wellness program has switched over to this as an alternative to soda."
2,"I ordered out of curiosity, but nurturme quickly became my favorite baby food. Now I'm on my third order. I've spent so much time staring at the baby food shelves and doing research online. I've tried Earths Best, Sprout, and Happy Baby, but I'm going to stick with Nutureme. First of all, my baby loves the taste. I love the small packaging, portability, and (most important for me) high nutritional value. I also like that it has more calories than other brands when you compare serving size. That tells me that other brands are watered down. My baby is small for his size, so I want him to have more calories per feeding. I'll feed my baby nuturme on its own or mixed with oatmeal cereal. Either way, it's super easy to use. My favorites are the apple, squash, and peas which seem exactly like their fresh counterparts. Unlike the other varieties, the dried sweet potatoes aren't as appealing as fresh. Sweet potatoes are so easy to make into baby food that I'd rather just make my own anyway. I probably wouldn't order the sweet potato version on its own, but I use it anyway as it's part of the variety pack."
1,"I had sampled <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and did not like it.  I thought it tasted powdery, so I had no hopes for this one.<br /><br />I'm glad I was wrong.  This was very good.  Tasty.<br /><br />I took one star off because ... well, no soda deserves 5 stars ... but mainly because there are a lot of calories for such a small tin, and the no sugar added label is deceptive since we all know that fruits have lots of naturally-occurring sugar and this is made from 100% fruit juice.<br /><br />Just on the taste alone though - definitely 4 stars."
2,"I was a big fan of this product since it was the only baby food that contained salmon until the ingredient was changed. The decrease in the protein content from 4g (old) to 1g (new) makes me wonder how much salmon is actually in this pouch. I can even tell from the smell of the new version which doesn't smell like fish at all that there is very little salmon in it. Also, the new version added apples and increased the sugar content from 0g(old) to 3g(new) which I am not happy about.<br />My son still loves this pouch, but I purchased this product for nutritious reasons - very disappointed with the change!"
0,"For those looking for a more exotic tea drinking experience and who like white Jasmine tea, Numi's Flower Jewel is worth a look. About the size of a gum-ball, these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower. They are meant to be decorative so glass teapot is a must when preparing this tea.<br /><br />Decorative does not mean tasteless. As a white tea, the flavor is mild, but rich and soothing. The jasmine is wonderful but does not overpower the tea. I have had stronger jasmine teas, but this one is quite balanced and tasty. I used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than 7 yummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade. The white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and don't get bitter if seeped for long periods.<br /><br />I must deduct some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels. Pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the 3rd or 4th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart, though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact. Some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf. Better packaging might solve this.<br /><br />If you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells, or are entertaining and want a conversation piece, then Numi Tea Flower Jewel should be on your short list."
4,"Researched the company, researched the ingredients. Customer Service people are great. Sent free coupons when e-mailed with a question about which of their cat foods best for my two kitties (regular or advanced).  Received good answers and not rote replies. This food is made in the USA with products from the USA and has all the ingredients I think are good for my cats. The two of them love, love this dry food and I have to ration it or they would chow day all day. I don't leave food out for any pet, cat or dog, to eat at will. They do not like Newman's canned food however so I don't force it on them."
4,"My 12 year-old Tonkinese cat not only loves this food, but she seems to feel better and be healthier after a few weeks on it. We'll see if there is enough fiber to keep the hairballs away, but for now I'm very pleased with this food. If hairballs become a problem, I'll mix in some of the Royal Canin intense hairball food."
2,I was really worried about giving my 11 month old chicken or really any meat products.  I really don't like trying to puree meat so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and it actually tasted great and wasn't lumpy.  This was one of the only meat baby foods that when I tasted - I loved it!  I felt like I was giving my child a complete meal and it was organic!
1,"This drink is a nice blend of juices (mostly orange) and carbonated water.  There are no other ingredients.  It has a decent amount of natural sugars from the juice, so it is not a low-calorie drink.  I thought the balance of flavors and sweetness was quite nice and would definitely buy again."
4,"Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.<br /><br />The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!<br /><br />I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it. As previously stated, maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it!  I've tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't!  It's all up to the cat!"
0,"Anyone looking for a good tea bargain and excellent quality taste, this is the deal. I could not find Lipton loose tea in the grocery store and longer, I found this at Amazon on line. The price, freshness and quality is great. I will be buying my Lipton tea here from now on. Everyone wants teabags, they really don't know what quaility is. Thank you very much."
1,"I thought this taste good, till about 20 mins after drinking some of the can.<br />Then It kept coming up (burping) yuck!<br /> I usually do not burp up my food.<br /><br /> I also did not find this very refreshing.<br />With that said, I'm not a soda drinker. I drink allot of water, which does not have 135 Calories for 8.3 oz.<br /> It says, No surgar added, No preservatives..Believe me, it does not need anymore of a sugar taste..<br />33 Gr. of natural sugar!<br /><br />If your a soda drinker etc. you might find this a better choice."
1,I really enjoyed this drink. The tangerine is very present and makes it very tasty. This drink is 100% natural and has no sugar added. The carbonation makes it a bit like a soda but a lighter and healthier one.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and I would definitely recommend it to others as an excellent alternative to regular soda.
2,"My baby didn't seem into these dinners, so I tried them. They're not terrible, but not good either. We'll stick with the EB fruits and veggies until she's ready for table foods."
0,"I did not buy this tea through amazon.. But from my grandmothers cabinet(haha). I have been dieting for the past 3 months now, and i was completely oblivious to special teas for cleansing although i know of drinks/pills that cleanse, I wanted to steer clear of any type of pill and again oblivious to benefits of cleansing(even when not dieting). Now I tried this tea two months ago & only because of the words ""Super Dieters"" I thought ohh special tea so i drank it(in the evening) it did for me do its job and loosen things up which i found odd at first then i read the package, and then I got it. So for me it did help being that I usually dont um go as much as I should and this has helped that. Not only that but since I have been using it along with my eatting habits, and exercise my diet has been showing better results nothing drastic but still better results and that is always great! This tea (Cinnamon Spice) I think tastes devine, I do add not even a teaspoon of sugar but I think this tea doesn't even need sugar at all(i just like it sweeter). But all in all I do and have recommended this tea to a few family members and friends(who do and dont diet) because i love the taste and the results I'm having with it."
1,"This has great flavor, but I am not sure it would be a soda alternate.  I am thinking it would be good for a lunch or mini fridge at work!  Tastes great, but I really did not get the carbonation kick I get from a soda."
4,"I have 3 mature cats, each has had some type of chronic problem ranging from obesity to chronic constipation.  I have tried a variety of canned diets with little to no success. Two weeks ago I switched them over to BG and I'm amazed in the change already.  The cat with chronic constipation has not had any problems, the one with chronic ""itchy"" skin has already shown improvement in her coat and is not frantically chewing and scratching.  My fat baby...that will take more than 2 weeks to determine any real improvement.<br />Over all THEY are happier, healthier and more active.  Oh, the Quail is a BIG hit!"
0,"this is a high quality oolong tea and i can't go back to bigelow, that's for sure! the taste is great, it is said to have slimming benefits, and the tea bags are a higher quality that don't come apart easily."
0,"This detox tea tastes so bad that I had to force it down! I thought that it would be a good thing to do a natural detox, but I could hardly get through one box, and had to gulp it down quickly to try to not taste or smell it. It also stained my teeth! I would NEVER take this tea again!"
1,"Let me start out by saying that one can of Switch just wasn't enough...at least not when you're sharing it!! In order to properly review this, I had my children join me in a little taste test of this product. Well, the best litmus test of whether something is good or not...is if your kids want more. And mine both did...but I wasn't sharing any more of this delicious drink. No sir, I'm happy to report that the remainder of this libation was imbibed by yours truly.<br /><br />I'm not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks, but Switch could switch my mind. The kiwi-strawberry taste was just right...not too sweet and blended well with the carbonation for a drink that was tasty and refreshing. In fact, this drink would be great for a hot day or after a workout when you want something with some bite and don't really want or need another soda.<br /><br />This is good stuff...get some."
1,"If you love orange soda but don't want to drink soda this is the perfect product for you.  This taste just like orange soda but is actually made of 100% real fruit juice.  no joke.  It really tastes good.  I loved it.<br /><br />However just b/c you don't have all the ""fake"" soda ingredients it still has tons of calories for 8.3 ounces 140 to be exact.  A can of soda has 150 for 12 ounces so I am not sure what the trade off is unles you want 100% of your vitamin C!"
0,"I like l.o.c green tea best of all green teas I've tasted,its smooth,not bitter and has a very natural sweetness to it.does not have the earthy bitterness or dirt taste that so many others do."
1,"pros:<br />1) 100% juice<br />2) no corn syrup<br />3) no extra sugar added<br />4) gluten free<br /><br />cons:<br />1) Cans are too small<br />2) Price way too high (probably because of the 100% juice)<br />(you could get 24 cans of arizona ice tea at the grocery store for roughly the same price, and arizona cans are like 3x as big)<br />3) too sweet tasting, not that refreshing .<br /><br />In conclusion, I probably wouldn't recommend it."
0,"Rated by America's Test Kitchen as the best tea for iced tea, Twinings English Breakfast tea is perfect for a hot cuppa or for a batch of fresh iced tea. Amazon has the best price I could find for this product, and I have been buying it online from them for several years."
1,"I really enjoy trying new things, so I found the idea of this soda pleasing. It is essentially carbonated fruit juice, so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink. This might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be. However, I think a very valid complaint comes from some that feel this ""natural"" drink tastes a bit artificial. This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always have a more muddled flavor.  Having tried many of the Switch flavors, I find this one, like the watermelon, a bit plain and unexciting for a drink which purports to ""switch"" my world around.  The flavor really reminds me of strawberry-kiwi Snapple, which isn't a bad thing other than the lack of originality, and the carbonation is very pleasant.  It is an expensive treat, but would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice.  If this is your first try at the Switch fruit sodas, I suggest trying the tangerine variety first, as it really better encapsulates the bright flavors of fresh fruit that I think the company is trying to achieve."
0,"I love awake tea, but I am mad that you can't get the labels off the tin to reuse it. Nor can you compost the nylon bags.  The packaging is not earth friendly.  Even though I love the tea leaves less chopped-up, I buy the other packaging.  What's wrong with you Tazo? Starbucks?  It can't be that bad to use a different glue for the cute tins so we can store rubber-bands in them!<br />It can't hurt your profit margin too much to use another fabric for your tea bags.  As soon as you do I will be a loyal customer!"
1,"Ive tried the Black Cherry version of this drink, and I prefer that to this. Both are light and refreshing and WAY better than fruit-flavored waters. YUK! You can tell by the taste these are definitely fruit juices but without the sticky, thick, sweetness of a non-carbonated drink. This orange tangerine flavor though - there's this weird taste to it one that hits you immediately. Not quite bitter, not quite metallic, but definitely not yummy - unless you like bitter fruit - not sour - bitter. Maybe it's too much carbonation for my taste. If you've tried the other flavors and are looking to try something new - think twice about this one. It is tingly and refreshing, but I won't order it again."
2,Only three jars came in a form edible to babies.  The rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water.  It also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture.<br />Pretty disappointing and a waste of money.
1,I'm a bit perplexed wondering what void in the beverage market this is intended to fill.  Imagine a super sweet slightly carbonated juice drink with an almost syrupy consistency and you have The Switch.  I had to drink a tall glass of water after drinking a can of this carbonated candy in a can because it's anything but refreshing.
0,I love the flavor of this tea. I wish it didn't come in nylon bags as I just can't make myself use and throw away all that plastic. I hope that they will come out with these flavors in a more ecologically responsible package.
1,"I have tried a couple of the Switch drinks now and as far as I'm concerned they have a great flavor. It is important to serve them ice cold. One of the cans I drank sat out of the fridge for a while before I cracked it open. It was still cool, but there was a distinct difference in the flavor from the ice cold version and not for the better. The carbonation is subtle and the sweetness is light and appropriate for the drink. I took off one star for the value of the drink. They are a little pricey for the size of the cans."
4,"Just like the other reviewer, my cat wants to eat these instead of his actual meals! LOL He's truly addicted. I am glad they have this formula with the hairball control, they have helped out so much and he rarely gets them anymore!"
0,"I love Sleepytime tea at night while I'm laying in bed reading a book, winding down for sleep. It has a fresh, comforting flavor, and a really great scent. It is a main part of my relaxing bedtime ritual, and I make use of Amazon's automatic re-ordering program, which saves me So Much money compared to grocery store prices. I only gave 4 stars because after about a week of drinking it every night it kind of loses it's charm. That's when I alternate it with Celestial's Tension Tamer, just to keep things interesting. Great product for herbal tea lovers, and again, a much better price here than in the grocery stores."
4,I've been using this all natural cat food for a few years when I could afford it but didn't think to shop where I buy my books.  With free shipping I only wish Amazon offered a few more flavors.  Since many commercial cat foods are made with Grade D mest (not fit for human consumption) I am delighted to have this choice.
0,This is my favorite tea. Regular green tea tastes a little bitter to me. The addition of the brown rice gives this tea a nice smokey flavor. In the winter I drink at least two cups a day...I can't get enough!
0,"I really enjoyed this Green Tea, and I can't wait to try making it as a Green Tea Latte... I love my Tassimo machine :)"
0,"This makes delicious hot tea in winter and iced in the warm months...I used to buy the Aveda licorice mint tea, but was so happy to discover this much more affordable option. Amazon has a great price with subscribe and save. I have a hard time finding it in our local stores so I'm very happy to buy from Amazon."
1,This drink is a nice change of pace from soda.  It is an all NATURAL beverage with NO JUNK IN IT.  It is made only of juice and carbonation and that is it.  We couldn't believe it when we tried it!  It tastes really great and if I were looking for a drink without caffeine I would choose this.  The Switch is really tasty and satisfying.  I also liked that the carbonation is not quite as heavy as some sodas.  My family of four tried it and we all decided that we would buy this brand again.
1,I use the Crystal Light Lemonade mix  with Sugar free Tang (one tub ea) with a gallon of water and 4 Tbsp Sweet N Low to make an excellent sugar free orange drink. No other mix gives this excellent results.
1,"Sometimes if too many flavors are mixed together, the result tastes like none of them.  This doesn't taste like orange or tangerine.  It tastes, to me at least, very sweet and sort of orangy but not tart at all, and I like my citrus type sodas to be tart and sort of sour.<br /><br />Still, great for those who are trying to get away from the high fructose corn syrup diet."
1,I have tried a couple different flavors of this soda and found it to be pretty good.Its lighter than regular soda.
1,"I am a moderate drinker of both sodas and juices, so I was intrigued by the promise of The Switch.  I would receive the vitamin benefits of my juices with the fizzy fun of a soda.  The can is slim, so it fits nicely in my lunch bag but would rattle around in my car cup holder if I decided to take it as a to-go breakfast drink.  Once I had it all nice and chilled, I popped the top and listed to the fizz.  It was not quite the satisfying pop and fizz of a Coca-Cola, but that is because this drink has less carbonation.  When I took a sip, I was immediately transported back to grade school field trips where we were given bag lunches with juice boxes.  While it was a nice moment of nostalgia, the novelty quickly wore off.  The juice was nice, but I am not sure the carbonation really added anything to it.<br /><br />My biggest concern really deals more with the people who may not do their due diligence before deciding to purchase this product.  If you have a soda addiction, but you drink diet soda, this would be a calorie explosion.  While it is natural juice, you must remember that natural juice is high in sugar.  If you are accustomed to guzzling three or four sodas per day (or more) then you would not want to replace them with this beverage.  It must be approached with the same dietary caution as you would use with regular juice.  But if you have difficulty drinking juice or getting your recommended fruit servings each day, this might be a fun alternative.<br /><br />The price is high compared to soda, but it is low compared to some other individually bottled/canned juices.  I really liked the light kiwi/berry taste more than the black cherry.  I think that it makes a nice treat, but it is not going to be complete substitute for me."
3,"A friend, who grew up in El Salvador, made some hot chocolate one night.  We all wanted know what ingredients he'd used - we loved the drink!  This was not the Quik of childhood.<br />I pop a piece into a large mug of skim milk - into the microwave for a bit/'til heated through.  Mix w/ a small egg whisk and enjoy."
2,"My daughter did not like this flavor, she will eat it with a little bit of vegetable or fruit puree every other bite.  It is a bit of a struggle, and honestly it is a strong fishy smell coming out of the package.  This is also a chunkier and drier pouch compared to the other flavors."
1,"I was anxious to try this, but upon the first sip it was apparent to me that this drink was not going to go well for me.  It has a very sharp/harsh citrus-y metallic flavor and combined with the overwhelming sweetness, the two seem to battle it out in my mouth for dominance.  After awhile it seemed like the drink was going down more like syrup more than a carbonated beverage.<br /><br />The can is small at 8.3 oz (a regular sized pop can is 12 oz) and the cost of these little guys seem a little bit astronomical.<br /><br />I also am a bit dubious of its attempts to seem like a healthy alternative to pop.  It still has loads of sugar in it.  So when they claim ""no additional sugar"" this may lead you to believe no sugar or low sugar... but it does in fact have 34 grams."
0,"I have had many different versions of Earl Grey tea and I am a fan, so when I read such raving reviews as this tea has received I had to try it. I now have three canisters of this Rishi version of Earl Grey and perhaps I will be more impressed by the second or third canister; so far however, I am not impressed. As I suspect, perhaps I received a stale batch, but the product I have been drinking is definitely not superior to Trader Joe's ""Earl Grey Tea"" bags in terms of strength or flavor."
1,"I think sodas are a big waste of money.  That said, I had the opportunity to try this and it is DIVINE!!!"
0,"good tea -- good for blood pressure. tastes good and smells good too.webvitamins good place to order from. fast and efficient, especially with amazon as the go-between."
0,"I am enjoying this tea and the price was reasonable.  I don't think the rose flavor is as pronounced as my favorite rose tea, but since I can not get that one at this time, I ordered this one, and it is very good."
2,"Well it's funny but Even though I am 28 Yrs old I love eating this in many flavors, I was born here and did not get the chance to grow up on this till almost three where my family went overseas and they used this nestle brand and I am hooked till now, It's really hard to get it here as I live in NH so I order it online<br />I really like it, and would recommend it and will defiantly feed it to my kids when I get some º"
1,"My family and I recently tasted this Switch drink (as well as the Black Cherry flavor).  I found the kiwi strawberry taste to not be very distinguishable (ie, without reading the can I would have jard a hard time guessing what the flavor was).  My husband thought this was better than the cherry flavor, as did the kids (ages 11 & 9).<br /><br />We all found this drink to be very sweet, even without the added sugars.  I was not impressed with this drink and would not buy it again."
2,"The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product, it's kind of like sucking on food through a cloth. While my daughter was interested in it for a little while, she eventually lost interest. I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts."
0,"This Earl Grey Tea has a zing to it, that I didn't have with a different brand.  My husband likes the zing, I am not sure about it.  It's worth trying, if you want a black tea that isn't real strong."
2,"this is perfect for babies and toddlers on the go! we started using the baby version when my daughter was an infant--it is so easy to throw a pouch and a baby spoon into the diaper bag. now that my daughter is older, she is able to feed herself with the pouch. just give your toddler the pouch and they will squeeze/suck the fruit out of it. not only is the packaging great, but the fruit tastes good as well (and yes, I have tasted everything that I feed my daughter). my daughter loves this--her whole face lights up when I hand her a pouch."
3,The US made version of this Cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the UK version of the chocolate which I have been eating since childhood. I did not like this new taste. To all my friends from India -- buy this chocolate if it is either made in UK or India; otherwise you will be disappointed as I was.
1,"For someone who cannot resist kiwi-flavored juices, unfortunately, THE SWITCH did not appear to have a kiwi berry taste.  However, the berry half stood out as well as the 100 % carbonated juice and after taste sweetness.  Indeed, this drink will appeal to a younger crowd and those who love a sweet carbonated drink that is not too heavily bubbly as a soft drink or too mild as any fruit juice.  And no doubt, it may satisfy that temporary thirst where drinkers will be switching for more."
1,"Let me preface this by saying I purchased it at a local health food store for about a dollar less. I was pleasantly surprised with this drink. It tastes great, but definitely a little tangy. What I loved about this was how great I felt after drinking it. I felt awake and focused, and just overall really good. I will definitely be buying more."
1,"These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola Juice Concentrates), Gum Acaia, Natural Flavors and colors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) and Soy. I was very surprised that this taste like a great Tangerine soda. Each can has 140 calories, 1orNo thanks I am  swimming from 15 mg of sodium, 34g of carbohydrates, 34g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C and 20 % of Vitamin A.<br /><br />I would be pleased to drink this sparkling orange/Tangerine flavored juice again. I found it to taste good and be a refreshing drink. But for my money I would rather by the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories."
0,We enjoy hot tea and we find Revolution tea to be of the best quality.<br />The tea bag itself is of the highest quality and there is never a single<br />tea leave in our tea.
2,"We discovered Earth's Best when my oldest started solids years ago.  They had a more limited selection then, but offered more variety than the ""regular"" brands.  For him, we only bought a few jars each trip, those flavors that we couldn't get in another brand.  For our second child, we added a few more.  With the 3rd baby, we started out on the larger brands, but he wouldn't eat them.  Who can blame him!?  They're runny and lacking any flavor.  Not to mention, no matter how good sweet potatoes are, how many jars can you eat?  He gobbles up every jar of Earth's Best without any problems.  When we introduce a new flavor, he's all for it.<br /><br />I agree with other posts that some of the flavors are very runny.  We just add a few tsp. of cereal and problem solved.<br /><br />Earth's Best is more expensive.  I calculated that every 2 weeks of food costs me $15 more than buying the other brands.  However, we decided that since he eats it all (vs. being very picky with other brands) it's a wash.<br /><br />If you want to use Earth's Best for your baby w/out breaking the bank, try these tips:<br />*Visit Earth's Best's website and print off all the coupons they'll allow (usually 3), have family and friends do the same<br /><br />*Buy at Whole Foods.  They have good prices and when you buy a lot, they give you a bulk discount<br /><br />*You can also buy them by the case at Meijers for less than $10.00, cheaper than here!"
0,"Quote ""Assam tea is known for its body, briskness, malty flavor, and strong, bright color.""<br /><br />This offering is pretty abysmal, it is lacking in every department, maybe it was mislabeled. I am not sure what I am going to do with it!!"
3,"I don't ven know why i ordered these, it was just on a whim. But what a surprise when I brewed myself some hot chocolate. The taste was unbelievable, just like homemade. Maybe a tad too sweet, but a tiny little bit of instant coffee added to it did the trick. Love it."
2,"Not sure why they decided to mess with a good thing. We've cancelled our subscriptions to both the Chick Chick and Salmon HappyBaby pouches. A huge disappointment to our family as these were two go to meals in our household for our 14 month old. Please bring back the old formula, HappyBaby!"
0,"the best, tastiest and fast making ice tea by the glass, does not leave an after taste, like a delicate summer breeze in a glass, fresh ice tea anytime of day or night, great for company"
0,"This is my favorite tea to brew for breakfast.  The orange peel, peppermint leaf and other flavors mixed<br />with the tea infuse it with a delightful, tropical flavor.  The nylon infuser tea bag is the best.<br />I purchased six boxes for a great price from Amazon."
1,"I think the Switch is a beverage with soda replacement in mind.  The can boasts it contains 100% of what one wants (being all natural, 100% juice, full daily serving of vitamin C, and the clincher, carbonated), while having 0% of what you don't want (no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or colors.)<br /><br />The Good - So with that in mind, I have to agree that it is refreshing to see companies trying to fill the void in ""sodas"" with no corn syrup, with tons of juice and vitamins to boot.  I like that you get a full dose of vitamin C, and a little bit of A.  As for taste, it has a nice slightly crisp bite of carbonation, and it's very orange tangerine-y.  It's a little heavy (read syrupy without being too sweet), but it does have a reconstituted juice base, so it gets a pass.  It's also in a single serving-size can (8.3oz), which is nice considering I typically treat most 20oz bottles as a serving, even though it's 2 and a half and I tend never do the math to figure out the true content of what I'm drinking.<br /><br />The Bad - The price is a bit steep.  At about a dollar a can, it's roughly twice the price as most 100% juices you can find, including most selections of orange juice.  Whereas a 64 ounce carton of Tropicana will run you upwards of four dollars, 8 cans of the Switch would cost eight bucks.  For soda lovers, the Switch is about twice the cost compared to your average 20oz bottle, and roughly 4 times the cost of cans (when comparing equal amount by the ounce.)  Also, read the ingredients, it contains more apple and grape juice than orange or tangerine, which means that the taste is probably aided by the natural flavors (which doesn't mean oranges, just that it was derived from natural substances not chemically made.)<br /><br />The Ugly - The Switch seems straight forward, but it's also a little devious which leads me to my biggest complaint.  Granted it's all natural, but each 8oz can contains 36g of carbs, 34 of sugar alone.  That's more sugar than soda, in some cases by almost 10 grams a serving.  More sugar (even if it's not corn syrup) is more calories per can, so even at it's single serving size you'd almost be better off drinking a Coke and taking a vitamin C pill."
2,"we make our own fruits and veggies to use at home or at daycare.  however, storing them while we travel is challenging so we use the earths best on trips.  the flavor is wonderful, the ingredients are simple and organic and we feel good giving this to our 7 month old.  she loved all of the flavors in this variety pack so much that we are trying to replicate them at home.  we also keep these in the pantry as back up."
0,"It smells good, tastes like black tea, and it is decaffeinated.  I didn't really taste the creamy sweet flavor of vanilla.  In other words, the tea tastes like normal black tea if not for the vanilla aroma.  I think I'll go back to green tea based tea."
0,"i have never liked green tea but i knew it was good for me so i have been drinking it for a lot of yrs. i grew up living in the western usa and our neighbors were japanese. they were sweet and gave us tea from japan. my father enjoyed it every morning and added a tablespoon of honey and a little cream to it. he smoked all his life and died at 92. anyway, i found when at times i would quit drinking it i wouldn't feel as good as i did when drinking it. i got tired of boiling the water with the teabags and then getting everything in a container to put into the frig. i really drank a lot of it.  well, i stumbled onto a warehouse to pick up some things i had ordered and noticed this tea. i was immediately interested as you get to drink the whole tea leaf which gives you 10 times more antioxidants. wow, that was good for me so i got a couple cases and when i ran out searched the internet for stash brand. i really love it. i love that it is LIGHTLY SWEETENED, i love that i can just open a packet and throw it into my tumbler, add ice and water and be on my way. it's just right. but more then anything else i love the way it makes me feel. so much more energy and i truly believe it is helping my well being. no getting around about it i don't get sick often for sure. now i haven't tried the other brands and i feel i don't have to because i am so satisfied with this one. the price is also cheaper. i don't think you can go wrong with this choice.  perky"
0,The packaging is so cute on all of Ashby's teas and the tea is exceptional. I would recommend this tea to anyone.
2,Mackerel is a tasty alternative to salmon with nearly the same Omega 3 content. My local grocery store hasn't been able to get tinned mackerel for several months. No one can explain why. So I ordered a case of these and have been pleased with the quality and value. I'm reordering.
0,"If it were possible to give this product zero stars, I would have done so.  I am a huge fan of Twinings teas, and was very excited to try this new blend.  After arriving home from the grocery, I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner.  Between sorting, washing, and chopping items, the hot water was added to the bag to steep.  Preparation continued, until a distinctly off odor hit me.  I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid!  I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea.  Even after cleaning up, and airing out the kitchen, my roommate later came in and asked about the smell.  Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product."
3,"Having liked the various types of Ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa's I decided to try some Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Hot Cocoa Mix, Chocolate Mocha. After trying several cups of this I started to wonder what happened to the Ghirardelli Chocolate as myself I thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste. Not my cup of hot cocoa!!"
1,"The flavor is pretty good.  It's sweet, tart, and tangy.  The calories are okay, 135 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  You wouldn't want to drink a lot of it every day, but 135 calories is fine for once or twice a day.  The fizz is light, similar to Fanta, which is something I really like about this product.  The only thing I don't like is the taste that the vitamin c adds.  The extra vitamin c gives it an aftertaste similar to red bull and other energy drinks.  I think this product would taste a lot better without it, and I don't see any real value in having it.  Vitamin C is one of the easiest vitamins to get.  There aren't a lot of people in the modern world running around with scurvy.<br /><br />The other concern is price.  This stuff is very expensive, almost $1 per 8.3 oz can.  The idea here is suppose to be that this is a soda replacement.  At that price, I don't think so.  A 12 pack of soda (with 12 oz cans) typially runs from $3 - $5.  The Switch costs more than double that.  If this product wants to compete with the soda market they really need to bring the price down.<br /><br />If you like this, just get some low sodium Pellegrino and some concentrated juices.  You can mix your own for a lot less and not have the vitamin c aftertaste."
1,"I'm always on the lookout for soda's that are made using real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice instead of chemicals. Switch's ingredients are: Filtered Water, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates, gum acacia, natural flavors and colors and ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). It also says it contains soy so avoid it if you are allergic to soy. One can contains 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin A. It also contains 34 grams of sugar and it tastes like it.<br /><br />The taste of Switch is very similar to regular orange soda which includes the syrupy taste that orange soda has. I personally don't like the syrupy taste and think this is way too sweet. I can see kid's liking the taste however and it is a much better alternative to regular orange soda. 34 grams of sugar is a lot for 8.3 ounces of a drink. I would avoid it for myself but may use it as an occasional substitute for my kids."
1,"I've tried other flavors of Switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them. However, this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet. I felt like I was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down. While I would probably purchase the other flavors of Switch, I definitely would not purchase this one."
2,"Our primary reason for buying this product is that it came in a variety pack.  We make most of our own baby food, but we were going on vacation and that was going to be difficult.  Since packing space was limited, we had this shipped to our destination.  It was the only brand we could find to order in a variety pack.  The kids liked all the flavors and the consistency seemed good."
0,What I like about Assam tea is the specific flavor that distinguishes it from all other teas. High blood pressure forced me to try a decaffeinated version. I found the resulting tea disappointing: It lost a real lot of its flavor.
4,"I was so happy to find this food on Amazon.com. I love this food for my cat. It keeps his teeth fresh and makes his breath smell better. It's a little pricey but well worth the price because I find that it's healthy for my cat, meaning he likes it and I don't have to get scratched up trying to brush his teeth, OUCH!"
1,"I like the idea of a healthy soda type drink, but this flavor just missed the mark. The tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth. Carbonated juice is a great idea, they just need to tweak the flavors a bit.<br /><br />Ranking the Switch drinks from best to worst:<br /><br />1. Watermelon Strawberry<br />2. Kiwi Berry<br />3. Black Cherry<br />4. Orange Tangerine"
1,"I expected to like this drink because I like various fruit juices and I like carbonated beverages, as well.  Unfortunately, I just did not like the consistency or the taste of this drink. It was thick, had very little bubbly carbonation and, for me anyway, there was a very unpleasant aftertaste that lasted a loooong time.  I finally brushed my teeth really well and used some strong mouthwash to get rid of the taste in my mouth."
0,"This is not only one of the best tasting green teas out there, I absolutely swear by it for when you're getting a cold or have one. It works miracles. Everyone in my family got sick this winter & I did for a bit (I didn't have my tea) and then I got it & was better within a couple days. As a mom of 4 that's imperative! My husband got sick several times & I kept telling him to drnk the tea!  The last time he finally listened & ended up not even missing any days at work. He keeps a box for himself at work now. You don't have to be sick tho, it's a great tasting tea...even if you don't like green tea. And the bonus is that it's good for you!"
2,"My 17 month old can easily eat the whole can in one day if I'd let him. He LOVES these puffs! He just munches on them like they are chocolate (or something that one really loves!). I just lay a bunch on his little table and he will just pick them up so fast and as soon as he is done he'll start whining for more. He does not do that with any other snack! It's insane! I have tried them and I must confess they are good, but can get expensive if baby gets addicted to them. I obviously buy these in bulk. We've only tried the carrot/cheese... I think the other flavor because of the green color may confuse him but I will try those as well as soon as we are done with this pack!"
1,"The mixture of juices they use to sweeten this give it a little bit of an odd taste and makes it too sweet.  It's not a straight orange/citrus flavor.  Not being an apple juice fan I wasn't fond of it.<br /><br />I gave it four stars b/c it is what it advertises - it's juice with sparkling water, unlike some other ""healthy"" sparkling beverages that are basically soda.<br /><br />For sparkling juice I prefer IZZE - it's a little less sweet."
0,"I don't enjoy giving products a bad review but I was so disappointed I had to.  I've tried quite a few teas and I've been able to drink teas that others say taste like dirty dish water so I can get down some pretty harsh teas.  I usually don't use any type of sweeteners either because I drink my tea right before bed.  I've tried to give this tea a chance.  Ive tried it with sugar, honey and lemon and masking the flavor with vanilla and a little milk.  To me, this tea smells like dirty feet and probably tastes like them too.  I've also tried straight chamomile teas before too so I know it's not that.  I would rather eat the plant itself than drink this tea.  I haven't tried any other Twinings products so this review is strictly for this product."
4,I have the coolest different cats ever-with some exotic in them-and this stuff is amazing and really they seem to love it! It does not make the poo smell bad and the digestive system of some of mine-do not tolerate much grain or gluten so that is VERY much a PLUS!  The price on amazon is better for a large-can (amount / per ounce) than i can find at local pet shops or stores.  So when you can get the free shipping it is REALLY awesome to have pet foods at your door-service too! I hope Amazon will just continue to make pet food / supplies to your home affordable and at a top price!  Sometimes though when i go to try to re order cannot find (the same deals)available.  So I just lurk and watch and wait sometimes til it is Offered again to make it affordable. Not sure why -that happens but i know i have to (watch it) to make sure i don't end up with a high shipping fee in my cart-prior to purchase.
0,"i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp."
2,my super picky baby loves this. it taste good.packaging are so convenient too. when she wont eat anything else i always resort to this.
1,I have been searching for a natural lemonade drink mix that would actually taste good.  This is not one of them.  Did not like the the bitter taste of this drink mix. I can make my own fresh squeezed lemonade better than this stuff.  In the mean time I purchase Newmans Own ready made lemonade if I don't have the time to make my own lemonade.
1,"I had hoped that this would taste like Pina Coladas but it doesn't.  It is rather nasty and left a film on my tongue.  I wanted something to drink after a work out or to give to my kids when we are traveling but it is to hard for me to swallow.  The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is good in mixed drinks.  I have been able to add it to smoothies and drinks with alcohol.  If you are going to drink this straight, it helps if it is really cold....almost frozen.  If you really like the taste of coconut milk you might like this because that is the only thing I can taste in it,"
2,"My 6-month-old is a fanatic for these flavors!  She gobbles them up and we can't load the spoon fast enough for her!  We introduce new foods every 3 days and we always get the interesting blends as well, so she has tried tons of flavor profiles by this point and these really do get a notable reaction from her.  She goes, ""Mmm, mmm,"" lol.  It's so cute and meats are an easier-to-absorb source of iron compared to artificially-enriched iron that is found in baby cereals.  I definitely prefer this as a compliment to Mommy's milk as oppose to the cereals that are hard for little tummies to digest."
0,"The packaging is great for a gift.  The teabags are pyramidal in shape.  As far as taste, if you're just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla, then this Tazo brand will do it for you. If you're looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste, then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea, Tazo, will disappoint you.  The raw rooibos taste, without these ""improvements"" such as vanilla, is full-bodied and has its own unique taste.  I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings, Republic of Tea, and Numi."
1,"One sip brought back childhood memories from Hong Kong. Vitasoy is one of the best soy drinks on the market, and though its hard to find online or elsewhere in America, it's worth every cent.<br />Technically it has no preservatives, and that's one of the best things about it, other companies will write ""no preservatives added"", but will actually hide some through technicalities, however Vitasoy's high temp. method actually guarantees no preservatives"
1,"This water is delicious. I'm not picky, but I can taste bad water with chemicals or metal taste and this has none of that. And at 50 cents per bottle, delivered to your door, it's a great price. I have a teenage son and he drinks these all the time and it's a-okay with me. Better than drinking a coke."
3,"Getting really good cocoa out of a K-cup is not easy but this is much better than the others I have tried. Still a little wattery, but at 60 calories it is a nice treat.  very rich flavor - not as good as the real thing, bit I am not drinking it in a Berlin Chocolate shop either.  Put your slippers on, sit in front of the fireplace with your sweetie, and enjoy!<br /><br />60 cal (20 fat)  --  2g fat sat  --  11 carb  --  6g sugar  --  &lt;1g fiber"
2,My daughter absolutely loves this stuff and she is a very picky eater.  It is also hard to find in the supermarket.
1,"The taste of this was like a pop but it was very refreshing to the mouth.  I liked it because it was healthier than a pop , had great taste and it was very refreshing."
1,"SWITCH isn't a bad product, but it's not great either. I like the fact that it's all natural sparkling juice, and the can design is pleasant to look at.<br /><br />The orange tangerine isn't bad; this flavor isn't as syrupy as some of Switch's others.  However, at 140 calories per can, this beverage has 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda. Too many for me."
1,"I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me.<br /><br />Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.<br /><br />And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.<br /><br />That's great.<br /><br />So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.<br /><br />Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.<br /><br />But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).<br /><br />On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.<br /><br />Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas."
3,"I love chocolate with cinnamon in it, and artisan chocolates in general, so i had such high hopes for this product. It disappointed me.<br /><br />First off, it was grainy, in a too-much-sugar way, not a coarsely-ground-cacao-way. If you break off a piece, you can see the sugar crystals glinting in the chocolate.<br /><br />Second, it had almost no flavor. I couldn't taste the cinnamon at all, and the even chocolate itself was weak.<br /><br />It smells wonderful, but tastes like grainy nothing."
1,"I just tried the Orange tangerine version of The Switched carbonated drink and overall I like it.  It tastes very similar to mandarin orange Slice but it uses natural juices and no HFCS.  If you are very concerned about artificial flavors and HCFS, but still want a carbonated drink, then Switched may be a good alternative.  I read the ingrediants list and it mainly included reconstituted juces and then aboiut another line of preservatives and additives, I would assume similar to those in commercial fruit juices.<br /><br />Personally, I am more concerned about overall sugar and calories in my soft drinks so this little 8 oz can has 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar.  If memory serves me that is in line with the calories of most softdrinks and more sugar then most soft drinks.<br /><br />Ultimately, i think this is a good tasing product, but the touted benefits doesn't outweigh the increased price and availability conpared to regualar soda.  I guess the key is still moderation."
1,Good chocolate. You can actually taste the orange citrus flavor. It complements the chocolate and doesn't dominate the flavor.  Great treat.
4,"I have 5 cats, of whom 4 live inside and 1 is outside. It is quite difficult to find one food that appeals to this myriad of tastes. Seems like someone has a ""no thank you,"" ""are you kidding me"", ""not on your life'"" or a plain ""yeech!"" on any choice i see that looks just delightful.But no, I am the human Momcat and my tastes are just not the same of those as the princes and princesses in my care.<br /><br />But Merrick Grammys Pot Pie Cat Food has hit the rare airy quality of being one of the few foods that is eaten by everyone, all the time, each time it is served. That is a heady rating. There are only a couple of other foods which have reached that level at our house. One is the White Meat and Chicken by Pro Plan.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ODAS9M"">Pro Plan White Meat Chicken & Vegetable Entree Adult Canned Cat Food in Gravy</a> The second is Salmon and Chicken by Tiki<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AN8JDK"">Tiki Cat Consomme, 8-Pack, 6-Ounce Can, Napili Luau Wild Salmon and Chicken in Chicken</a>The Third is Tilapia by Fancy Feast.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQDDY"">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Steamed Tilapia, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a>.<br /><br />So of all the cat foods I buy, only four are always eaten, by everyone, all the time and Grammys pot pie is one of them. SO the kitters have asked me to try some other flavor by Merrick. I will try, for their sake...for them anything...but I doubt a raging success. Some things always look great at the start, but then do not make it to the ""all the time, every time, every one"" category.<br /><br />But, my guys give this 5 stars and say ""thank you"" for reading what we think: Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty. It is a 5 star meal for us and we think your kids will like it also, so give it a try...""you know, for their sake, or however she says that."" ""We agree on this Merrick!!!"""
1,"This Switch Kiwi Berry drink comes is as great, easy to handle, streamlined candy.  However, it does delivery an intense, fruit, flavor.  Great when you really need a sweet fruit recovery from a hot summer day.  Otherwise, a bit overpowering. A nice treat though."
2,"According to a lot of reviews on top baby food brands overall, Earth's Best was always voted to be in the Top 5 of all the lists of reviews by Mom Links, Consumer Reports, Livestrong, Baby Health Sites.  Here is a excerpt from one of the sites (I think it was from eHow.com):<br /><br />The Center for Science in the Public Interest evaluated popular brands of baby foods, including Gerbers, Heinz, Earth's Best and Beech-Nut. According to the Center's report, Earth's Best did not use starchy fillers or ""replace real food with water and thickening agents in many of their products for children over six months of age. Such adulterated products are nutritionally inferior to products made with more fruits and vegetables."" Earth's Best uses certified organic products. The brand offers single-ingredient, smooth foods for infants over four months; fruit, vegetable, grain and meat blends for babies over six months; and a variety of chunky soups, dinners and vegetable medleys for children over nine months old. Earth's Best products are sold at supermarkets, natural food stores and big box stores nationwide.<br /><br />Plus, my baby girl loves it.  Yes, it might be a little runnier than the other baby foods, but I just add a little rice with it and that fixes it."
1,"I was really looking forward to this beverage, as I love tangerine juice and the thought the combination of orange, tangerine and carbonated water would make for a great soda.<br /><br />I have to say, it is different, but not what I expected. While it was different than a typical orange soda, I didn't find it THAT different, either in sweetness or taste. I probably prefer it to traditional orange sodas and I believe it to be vastly superior to many supposedly ""natural"" sodas, but I was surprised how similar it really is to artificially-flavored drinks. A bit more (maybe a lot more) orange and tangerine juice would be good."
3,Love this hot chocolate--nice creamy flavor.  The price is good and I love the single packs.  This is not a flavor available to me locally.
1,"As a juice freak, I sample just about all of them. Any different fruit and taste is top for me. So I gave this a try, and it is among the best. So, next time you want a refreshing, tasty , and healthy drink, scoop up some SWITCH!"
0,"I've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box.  I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes.<br />This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse."
0,"Good value, good tea. We've been  using it for years and it always makes a good pot of tea."
0,Just received and made last night.  Very good tasting.<br />This 16oz bag is a lot of tea - more than I thought. Glad I have though.<br />Nice packaging -- but will put in tins because of the amount to keep it fresh longer.
0,"I was at a 5 star hotel and was served this tea during a meeting.  It was fantastic.  I asked the server if they could get me the name of the company, but they were unable.  Thank goodness for Amazon I was able to find it.  It's the best I have had in many years.  It arrived on time and very securely packed."
1,"Switch Kiwi Berry is the perfect blend of tangy, tart, and sweet, with a delicious dose of kiwi flavor and subdued berry taste.<br /><br />This drink is bubbly, but better than a soda because:  1 - it is clean, not sticky, 2 - it is 100% fruit juice, 3 - there is no added sugar, 4 - there is no added anything else that is bad.<br /><br />This is a healthy drink, but it could trick us into believing it is bad.  I have only good things to say about Switch drinks, and can't think of one bad thing about it.<br /><br />This drink would be a perfect substitute for soda with whatever you would normally drink soda with, such as:  sandwich and chips, pizza, tacos, grapes and cheese and crackers, nachos."
1,"This product taste like an orange juice, an artificial one but with less sugar and less flavor I didn't like it."
3,"Looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water. No chocolate flavor whatsoever, this was a complete disappointment.  I got the hot chocolate k-cups from swiss miss instead.  How people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me, is the Amazon ratings system being gamed for this product?"
0,"Excellent way to make good old fashioned tea, beats tea bags ""HANDS DOWN""! Will continue to buy this product and spread the word how ""REAL TEA"" is made.:)"
2,"I have a 3-year-old and a 9-year-old that love these! The best thing is that they are healthy. They are vegan, so no dairy, eggs or other animal products. They are also fruit juice sweetened and made with whole grains. Absolutely nothing artifical. They have little chocolate chips in them and taste yummy! I'm so glad that Amazon carries them because they are much cheaper to buy by the case then at local health food stores or through the company website."
1,"Ouch, this stuff is sweet, as in REALLY sweet...  This is really harsh tasting and we were disappointed.  Most soda doesn't have this much sugar, the 8.3 oz can has 29 grams of sugar, yikes!  For a 12 oz can of soda, that would be like having 45 grams of sugar, who would drink that?<br /><br />They need to water this WAY down, we're going to end up giving the rest of this away, we can't drink it."
0,"Tea tastes great.  Overflows my ice tea maker, but worth it; I guess.  Tazo is better but much more expensive."
2,"My son used to love the Chick Chick, Gobble Gobble, and Super Salmon. But they changed the recipe, and now it's more corn than anything else. Taste is bad too. Nutrition value is lower. He doesn't like it, and neither do I. I am totally pissed."
0,"My Italian grandmother got me hooked on Lipton Loose Tea as a child. Tea is important to me- I never have gotten into coffee.  It has been increasingly more difficult to find Lipton Loose in supermarkets, so I have tried to find something to replace it- more expensive, ""fancier"" teas just aren't as good.  This is a great product- sooo much better than tea bags.  We like it hot &/or iced.  People always ask me ""What kind of tea is this?"" and then are so surprised to find out that it is good old reliable Lipton.  Tea lovers- don't be snobs!  Give Lipton Loose Tea a try.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!"
0,"When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this."
0,"I was skeptical because I've seen mixed reviews on similar products like this.  But I'm glad I jumped in and decided to purchase it.  First of all the shipping was fast and it comes gift-wrapped free which is cool.  Second, the glass works great which is most important.  Its double-walled so when I poured my boiling hot water in the glass I had no problem carrying it from the kitchen to my bedroom and barely feeling any warmth.  The filter/strainer does exactly what its supposed to do which is keep the loose tea out of your mouth while you drink your tea.  This is the first time I've used something like this and it works perfectly for me.<br /><br />The blooming tea comes in three small containers.  I'm new to tea so I can't tell what kind it is...most likely some type of jasmine green tea because it smells good.  The first steeping is very mild but the second one the flavor really comes out.  Anyway I hope this helps people that are on the fence like I was about buying glasses like this.  This package is legit and well worth the price."
1,"tastes like a carbonated fruit juice that really close to soda, but not exactly.good stuff though!carbonation will still wreak havoc on your stomach though, so don't accept it as ""healthy"" just yet."
0,chrysanthemum tea taste great with lemons and Apriva. chrysanthemum tea is caffeine free that's great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure.
1,"I don't read every label on every drink or food I consume. I understand the switch philosophy and can appreciate the idea. I must say that if you are really health conscious and want to consume what's good for your body then you would stick with mostly filtered water and natural 100% juices that are fresh that day. With that being said I do know that everyone in my family liked the switch drink and this particular flavor (kiwi berry). I now see switch in supermarkets and have purchased a few  single cans at lunch on occasion. I don't see myself purchasing in bulk however, as they are kind of expensive."
1,This is a great substitute for soda. It can be easily prepared before heading on a trip or just running errands. Tastes great with few calories. Save money and calories by taking this with you. Using a subscription saves even more. I don't run out and don't have to be worried that the grocery store has run out.
3,"I've tried a few different Hot Cocoa brands for my Keurig... And have been disappointed EVERY time, until now! Cocoa brews smooth and full flavored-on either the small cup size or the medium! I add a splash of almond milk and I'm ready to go :) Perfect! I'll definitely buy this again."
4,My 2 cats really like this cat food best of all! I have regular deliveries in order to be sure to have an ample amount available.
1,Celsius drinks are low carbonated and that is important to me.  My very favorites are the orange and the wildberry.  Thay do not burn calories.  They burn calories if you exercise and eat right.  I think that is quite funny but also misleading if you don't read the fine print.
1,"This product is good. However, I feel the carbonation is a little more emphasised over the fruity flavor. Unless of course carbonation is really wanted. I didn't find the juice flavour as good as Juicy Juice. And the cost is ~50% more per ounce for Switch vs. Juicy Juice for my region.<br /><br />I would say that for everyone who is interested in this product... let your taste buds be your guide."
1,"Roses Lime Juice has that lime flavor that the knock-offs do not have.  Roses has just the right amount of sugar so that it's not too sweet. Great for making any kind of gimlet...vodka, gin or even tequila (my favorite).  Since liquor is expensive don't settle for less than the ""Original"" !"
0,"A friend gave me a tea bag to try while at work yesterday.  I accidentally oversteeped the tea and expected a very strong bitter brew.  I was very happy with the smoothness of this tea.  While it was quite strong, nothing was overpowering and the bitterness I expected was not present at all.<br /><br />My 2nd brewing was done with more care.  This tea has an exceptionally smooth taste and excellent flavor.  I'll be buying Ahmad tea in the future."
1,"Switch is the ""all natural"" soda that has no sugar, artificial sweeteners or preservatives and with vitamin C.  The flavor in question is kiwi berry.  I must admit this is the third beverage by Switch that I have tried and I believe it tastes the best.  The other flavors I have tried didn't taste bad, but really didn't taste like the flavors they were promoting.  This soda tastes both like kiwi and berry.  A very crisp and light flavored drink and it is only 135 calories a can.  This isn't a bad alternative to a basic can of soda, but the calories in a can of Switch aren't too far from a can of Coke/Pepsi."
3,These k-cups are just what my son wanted!  The price was excellent and the flavor is rich.  I would recommend these to anyone wanting a good cup of instant hot cocoa.
1,"A nutritionist once told me she could find something good about every food...except soda. Pop is full of CO2 (carbon dioxide), something our body is trying to get rid of, and refined sugar (which can ruin the teeth and provides empty calories). But even so, I still love it. I love the fizz tingling down my throat while while cleaning my palate and replacing it with sweetness. Nutri-sweet brings down the calories at the expense of flavor and has side effects like headaches and giving me a gnawing hunger.<br /><br />For fun occasions, I'll mix lemon-lime or plain soda water with juices for a delightful, and slightly healthier alternative to soda. Will the Switch Orange Tangerine soda live up to my expectations? A carbonated juice in a can?<br /><br />At first glance, the Switch can is...cute. It's a slender can with nice artwork. Fun to hold in your hand when you're used to the typical can.<br /><br />But when I taste it, I'm sorry to say, I'm a little disappointed. The Orange Tangerine Switch soda is not as tasty as regular orange soda, nor as orange juice. For a disclaimer, I'll mention that orange juice is not something that would normally taste great carbonated, so the other flavors of Switch might taste better. I got a kind of odd, bitter taste as I drunk the soda, but afterwards there was a pleasant aftertaste. The bitterness might be present in regular soda, but this is orange juice (with some others mixed in) and I know how it tastes without carbonation.<br /><br />I gave the Switch soda to both of my daughters who happily swigged it down with no concern from the odd taste I noticed.<br /><br />So while I won't be happily exchanging my occasional soda for Switch, I'm glad they are trying to do something a little healthier than we can feel more comfortable giving our children. And really, on a hot day, this would hit the spot."
4,My cat Tigger eats this stuff up fast. Then he asks for more so I figure it must be good. This is not your typical cat food!
0,"Mostly bought this tea assortment for the Chocolate Mint flavor, which has been disappointing. Has a fake chocolate taste. The only other flavors I've tried are Coconut Mango and White Peach. The White Peach is very good, while Coconut Mango is okay. I hope the other 3 flavors are better, otherwise I would say this 6-pack is a waste, which is a shame because I normally enjoy Stash teas."
4,"Okay, it does smell kind of like cat food. But it is packaged fish, which I think is what cat food is, so I guess that's not a huge surprise. My daughter really likes it, and I like that it's good for her, so overall we give this our seal of approval."
1,"The Switch in Orange Tangerine has perfect serving size to keep the sugar in-take at its minimum and naturally. The carbonated sensation adding extra awakening sparks to the taste buds!<br /><br />That was my wife's first impression.<br /><br />I like the ""fruit soda"" idea.  It maybe a better alternative soda if it is indeed made of natural orange, but it taste likes other carbonated orange flavored soda on the market.  The only benefit you are getting and not from the regular soda is it contains daily recommended 100% vitamin C. If the price is right, doesn't hurt to try."
2,"My baby boy loves eating this food, better than some Earth's best Stage 3 foods.  It doesn't taste too bad either.  I love the sweet potatoes in the food.  The pouch is great for on the go, not having to worry about glass food containers breaking in the diaper bag, especially when we go for hikes."
2,"My son has autism and is on the GFCF diet.  He loves this mix made into cookies.  I remove the chocolate chunks ( trying to keep them as low in sugar as possible)  and I add 8 tspns benefiber and 1/4 cup baby rice cereal to boost the nutrition.  Then I add 1/4 cup flax oil and 1/4 cup olive oil and bake on a pizza stone - they never burn on the pizza stone - might burn if cooked on conventional bakeware.  My son love these and he is a very very picky eater.  The brownies that this mix makes are fabulous, too.  Great for birthday parties."
0,"I use it to make large batches of chai for my wife who drinks it like crack.  Anyhow, she loves it, tastes good to me, i am no tea expert."
2,"I don't see how there can be good quality salmon in this or lentils.....it is mostly potato and pollack (substitute cheap fish) --- this is really terrible for organic baby food - ugh, if i only had a cat to feed it to...."
3,This hot mexican spiced ground chocolate is a great defroster for the winter blast weather.  I love sipping this hot chocolate while watching the snow flakes falling.
4,"I have three cats... have had cats for years, this food smells better than most, my cats like it, the ingredients appear to be better than the average cat food. So far, so good! i'll continue to use it for my cats"
0,"This was the worst tasting tea, actually the worst tasting anything, that I have ever consumed. I took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup. It tasted like dirt, which makes sense since it is a root. The rest of the tea bags are going in the trash."
4,"Great natural treat for my cat, whose health I want to keep strong for many years. And he loves them!!!"
1,"Another delicious old fashioned Boylan Bottleworks flavor of soda. I say old fashioned because they are a 100 year plus company that makes their sodas the way that everyone made them before they changed all the ingrediants in the 1970's. Their Black Cherry's deep flavor comes from a blend of different cherries along with other high class ingredients here. This is the only cherry soda I know that uses only a mix of pure natural black cherries for the flavor, no other fruit juices or artificial flavors mixed in to save money. As a result the cherry really does taste like cherry rather than a syrupy mess that has a hint of cherry. It has an authentic tart cherry mixed in the sweet, and you can taste the tart in the aftertaste. It even has a nice texture in the mouth. I know this sounds gushy but you have to try it!<br /><br />But it gets better, they used real cane sugar instead of the cheaper high fructose corn syrup that is used in all the big brand sodas. As a result the sweet is more clean, not as overpowering or syrupy. The carbonation is medium, again here is an issue of too much carbonation can detract from the flavor. Caffeine free. The bottle is very cool and nostalgic with a painted on label and raised letters on the glass, reminding you they have been in business since 1891. All in all a perfect black cherry soda, best I have ever had."
2,"My twin boys have loved this product - they gobbled it up.  And as a mom, I loved it because it was very tasty and unique.  But also because it used a lot of veggies that my boys don't often get in their diet, like peppers and eggplant.  Since I last bought this product on Amazon the entire recipe has changed and there is no indication of such in the Amazon description.  It now is almost all carrots (something that my boys eat constantly) and quinoa.  No eggplant.  Only red peppers as one of the last ingredients.  And amaranth, for which it is named, went from ingredient number two, to the end of the ingredient list just above the spices.  It is not nearly as tasty in my opinion, either.  It looks and tastes a lot more like the Super Salmon.To be honest, this is just an entirely different product.  My boys still eat it, but I was disappointed and might not buy it again."
0,"What a wonderful product!<br />I can drink it all times of the day, so obviously the original Sleepytime Tea causes no real drowsiness.<br /><br />I start my day with the tea and end it with the tea.<br />It makes me so relaxed and it's healthier then smoking..lol<br /><br />It's also made me a fan of sugarless tea.<br />Never again will I go back to sweet tea or terriable diet sodas!<br /><br />Try some Sleepytime Tea if you love tea! The flavor is amazing and very smooth as well as unique. It's great hot or cold!<br />You will not be dissappointed."
2,My daughter loves this food! I tried it and its good!Added bonus is the DHA.
1,"This had a nice citrus flavor, but it was too sweet and actually flat. I did not get any kind of fizz or sparkle. For the amount of sugar and calories, I rather would have eaten a piece of fruit and drank a glass of seltzer water - less calories and more satisfying in my mouth. I got this on GB special for about $13.52 for the case. I don't think I will purchase again."
0,I have been drinking this tea for several years. It is great when you feel Stressed. Within a few hours of drinking it makes me feel in a relaxed and peaceful state of mind. I highly recommend this tea.
1,"Right off the bat, know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />I had this with chips and it wasn't a great combination, so I had the drink by itself and it was much, much better. The kiwi berry flavor is pretty sweet (as kiwis and strawberries are), so I would probably recommend drinking this with a pastry or something like that. A fruity danish would be perfect. Pairing sweet to sweet is key.<br /><br />I'm really pleased with this flavor, so I will surely look into the other flavors available, most likely the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">watermelon strawberry</a> since I'll probably get a similar taste. Oh, and the can is cool too - it's like an energy drink can and thin for easy handling."
1,These are awesome. I liked the fruity soda combination. I enjoyed all the other flavors as well. I think they will be great for summer parties over ice. Very refreshing!
2,"These taste great and have a great texture.<br /><br />Our 2-year-old has little interest in eating fresh vegetables, but she loves these.  She actually prefers these over goldfish crackers or other products of dubious nutritional value!  To me, that fact is worth the expense -- it is worth the cost to get her to eat vegetables."
0,I have to agree with many of the posters below. Earl Grey is my favorite tea and I have tried every brand I have ever come across. I was completely floored by how good this tea is. It is absolutely the best Earl Grey I've ever had and that includes some pricey gourmet blends. And what a bargain: 3 tins for less than $20! Don't waste your time with anything else.
1,"This product is not a soda but a carbonated juice. This soda has a nice taste- its not as sweet and as pure orange-tasting as typical orange soda-like drinks. It's not pure orange juice- but made up of a mixture of several different juices including apple, orange, grape and tangerine.  That juice blend gives it a slightly tangy taste that is actually at first slightly surprising and mostly refreshing.  The carbonation also seems lighter to me than soda but it is definitely there.<br /><br />The things I like about this product are the smaller can size (8.3oz)which makes it a more appropriate serving that a regular soda.  I also like the bright packaging and the pleasant taste.  After reading the ingredients of SWITCH carefully- I see that it is all juice just as it claims- so its probably a better choice than a regular soda.<br /><br />This product has no added sugars just as advertised on the can- but buyer beware- its still kind of high in sugar because fruit juices are naturally high in sugar. As always be sure to read the label if you are concerned about sugar levels.<br /><br />Overall I think this product is a good size and has a pleasant taste- especially if you are looking for something that tastes like an orange juice blend.  Traditional orange soda fans might be slightly disappointed in the taste."
1,Our family is a huge fan of IZZE and this was right in line with that. The flavor was not too sweet and refreshing. My favorite way to enjoy this was with some ice and vodka...obviously that's only for those of you reading this that are 21 yrs or older!
0,This is one of the few teas that I will always have on hand.  It is a wonderful blend of beneficial herbs that has a great taste.  I drink it almost every day.
1,"The can says it's 100% juice, but the taste is ...powdery.  If you've ever had a glass of Kool-Aid or Crystal Light, you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />So there's that 'from powder' taste; also there is an aftertaste.  And all comes in a can the size of a Red Bull for 160 calories.<br /><br />I did not like it."
2,"This is the only way I can get my daughter to eat fish.  I often add extra coconut oil and cinnamon to improve the taste though.  She didn't like it the first time, but after a few attempts she enjoys it.  She screams when I try to feed her any other brand of salmon, and so I think this one is worth a try.  If they don't like it, just mix it with something they do like. Great ingredients, great product."
3,This is the best hot cocoa I've had in a K-Cup!  The taste is smooth and creamy.  It's perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink.  I would definitely recommend this product.  The best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so I never run out.
2,"My 1 year old will eat anything...well that was until I gave him Happybaby Gobble Gobble. Immediately when I opened the package I was turned off by it. It looked and smelled awful...this does not look like tastey baby food at all. Against my better judgement, I still let my son try it. The first bite he choked and gagged. I thought, ""ok, it's just too thick"". So I thinned it out with a bit of formula and tried again. Second bite he spit it out and tried to scrape off what was left on his tongue with his fingers! My son is NOT a picky eater by any means and loves food in general, so I knew this MUST be awful if he wouldn't eat it. Rather than torture my kid, I threw the rest out. Thankfully I had only purchased two pouches at the store before commiting to a pack of 16 on Amazon. If only I had read the reviews first!<br /><br />Bottom line, don't torture your kid with this OR waste your money!"
1,"I was just messing around on amazon when I ran into this add for beer nuts, when I noticed someone had left a review it was pretty funny, being the beer lover that I am, I had to try them,  well they're here now and I cant drink beer without them, they have a story on the back about how the guy got started in the 50's, and soon his beer nuts were in bars around america!  iIcan see why, they're pretty darn good."
1,"""The Switch"" reminds me a lot of carbonated apple cider. It has a carbonated sweet taste (with no sugar added, no preservatives according to the label). The label states that it has 100% Juice. To me it tastes light, on the diluted side, and very similar in taste to the apple cider bottle you serve kids for thanksgiving instead of real champagne. There is a slightly detectable taste of strawberry and maybe kiwi.<br /><br />Pros:<br />100% Vitamin C<br />Low Sodium of 15mg<br />Tastes good if you like the light carbonated Perrier-Like Taste.<br />Fat: 0mg<br /><br />Cons:<br />33g of sugar (although it says no sugar added)<br />34g of carbs - too much carbs if you're trying to cut down on carbs<br /><br />Conclusion: Keep in mind that this review reflects my personal opinion of the product beside the facts listed on the can. I personally prefer less carbonated fruit drinks with a stronger taste rather than the very light taste of this product. it is 135 calories for 8.3 fl oz. You also feel you need a glass of water to wash out the after taste. Overall, it tastes good and I can recommend it to anyone who's not trying to cut down on the amount of daily carbs or sugar intakes."
1,"This switch kiwi berry tasts like the Red-Bull energy drink...bit of sour and sweet but not too much sparkling gas. The overall taste is not bad (I like it), but I could not taste the kiwi or berry. If you are looking for kiwi or berry taste, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The label says no suger added, but the ingredient table shows 33g sugar? I guess the sugar all comes from the 100% juice itself. So much suger level is such a small can. That's kind of high...<br /><br />Overall, I like the taste and I think it's an enjoyable drink. But I won't recommend it due to the high suger level."
3,"This 53% percent cocoa semi-dark chocolate bar is the perfect choice for people who dont usually like dark chocolate.  Tasting nothing at all likke common dark chocolates like Hershey's (yuck), Santander's quality is excellent.  I highly recommend this and all other Santander chocaltes."
2,"I love these snacks because they are whole grain and organic. I also love the fact that they do not spill everywhere out of the snack cup like cheerios. I have also noticed that they do not leave a lot of crumbs, which makes Mommy happy."
2,"This is great!  It smells great!  I love all of the vegetables in it.  Texture is not chunky and is eaten very well by my triplets, even the one with just 4 teeth."
0,"This is an excellent tea unique to Twinings.  High quality tea leaves, pieces of citrus peel, and cornflower petals.  It has a delicate aroma, and is pleasant to drink in any mood and any weather.  I would highly recommend this tea."
1,"As I said in my first review of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, the good in The Switch outweighs the bad. The drink is tasty, and I prefer the carbonation over a straight juice product. I feel the carbonation imparts a slightly bitter finish, but that it adds to the drinkability of what is essentially a sweet but unimposing fruit flavor. So while there is nothing particularly wrong with the drink, I can't really get enthusiastic about it and I think there are better, tastier, and more economical selections available. It's a great change of pace but is not a threat to become a regular in my drink routine."
2,It tastes fine and the baby loves it. has DHA and is organic - which is important when having berries (but redundant when it comes to bananas)
3,"I was a little skeptical when I bought this, but it has really been a great purchase.  The cocoa is DELICIOUS!  It's so easy to just make my daughter and I some cocoa quickly before sitting down to watch a movie.  I didn't have to add anything to it, but I did add a tiny bit of milk just to cool it down.  I would definitely recommend this product and purchase it again."
1,"Switch's Kiwi Berry drink I found a little on the light side, in many ways.  Only 8.3 ounces with very little in the way of kiwi or strawberry flavoring (the can claims raspberry also and it was MIA also).  The most stand out flavor I could detect was the apple juice, which is the major ingrediant.  While this is 100% juice (from concentrate though) and nicely bubble (I shook mine up prior to drinking, no massive explosion or anything and I'm at altitude), I'd rather drink something something with either a little more flavor or a little more of it."
2,"Love the nutrition, but it was a little strong for my 7 month old who had just started solids at 6 months. (Exclusively BF) First couple of bits he gagged quite a bit, so we simply stuck it in our little $10 food processer from Wal-Mart and added 1/4 of a banana.  He wolfed it down like nothing.  Applesauce works well also.  Will definetly buy more!"
1,"Good kit, however using the F-pack (pear juice) made it WAY too sweet, I ordered two more and intent to blend the kits, the second two with out the added pear juice."
0,"I bought this tea as I like blueberries, and Stash is known as making good teas.  However, when I first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green (not very appetizing).  Once I mixed the powder with water, the resulting tea had no real flavor.  I feel like I wasted my money and can't get a refund."
0,This makes great iced tea. More flavor than regular tea. Refreshing. Recommend it. Hard to find in stores. Get it here.
1,"This drink flavor is so much better than the watermelon/strawberry flavored drink. This kiwi/berry drink is less sweet, and has less calories than the other Switch drink.  This drink contains 135 calories, with 33g surgar, 34g carbs. This is a carbonated juice drink with no added sugar or preservatives. I liked this drink better than the first drink I tried because it didn't taste as sweet as the watermelon/strawberry flavored drink. I am glad I took the opportunity to try a different flavor, this drink was refreshing, and thirst quenching. Thanks for the sample!"
1,"LOVE IT!!!  I have so far tried the watermelon, the cherry and now kiwi and this is my favorite one. It is all fruit juice and it is tangy, fruity and wonderful! It has in it the following in this order: 100%juice sparkling water, apple,grape,kiwi,acerola cherry,raspberry and strawberry. The raspberry adds a little more zing then the other flavors but they are all really excellent. You can taste a little of all the fruits in this drink but the raspberry, strawberry and kiwi jump out the most. I would recommend this to anyone. Would make a great mixed drink but it's so good you probably won't get that far. Really good stuff!"
0,"I first tried this tea when it came in a Numi sampler set that my daughter brought me for Christmas. I tried it and fell in love with it. Only problem is that no store in the area carried that tea so I ended up buying it online at Amazon and the price was fair, tea is amazing."
2,"Our pediatrician told me to include some form of meat at dinner for our baby. Unfortunately, two of the four varieties don't include meat. I don't think Summer Vegetable should be included in a dinner variety pack, that's what the vegetable variety pack is for. Also, the chicken and sweet potato is extremely runny and hard to feed to a baby."
1,"This drink is ok. A little pricier with several more calories and carbs than I would like, but it is a good alternative to soda. I am glad there's no artificial sweetener in it. It's sweet enough without it. I like the Crayons drinks better, but cannot find them anymore. I also like the flavor of the R.W. Knudsen Spritzers a little more."
2,"I bought these in the grocery store one day to ward off an upcoming tantrum and my toddler went crazy for them.  He is a big fan of the puff-type snacks and cheerios, but these and the blueberry ones are his favorite and he will pick them out of the mix I make for him with all different types of puffs.  They are quite a bit harder than the Plum Organics puffs that he also likes, but he just sucks on them and they dissolve.  The container is great because it is small enough to fit in my diaper bag and it also fits well in the cup holder of my car.  Amazon's price is much better than if I buy them individually in the supermarket."
0,This tea is very good Matcha Tea.  I also enjoyed matcha tea from Tea Trim which is more affordable also.  Either way you wont be dissapointed
1,"This product is labeled ""100% of what you want"". But one look at the nutrition facts and you may not agree. While it contains 100% juice and vitamin C, no preservatives or sugar, it contains 135 calories, 15 mg of sodium, and a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrates. All this in a tiny 8.3 oz can! I also thought it was too sweet for my tastes, but I normally drink a diet carbonated beverage, so the sweetness did jump out at me. Just okay. I won't add this to my shopping list."
3,"Everything you'd want from a Hot Chocolate...creamy, milky, tasty, makes you happy :) I can't wait to try the other flavors!"
0,This tea is full of flavor without bitterness.  No additions needed.  You will not be disappointed.  Do not try this Earl Grey if you do not like bergamot.
0,this product came as advertized..it was a great buy and I love the taste of the tea<br /><br />great deal and happy i purchase from them.
0,The tea arrived as advertised.  It was a gift for my parents who love to have tea.  They do not like any Herbal varieties. Twinings tea is always good and this selection of teas (non - Herbal) was perfect for them.
3,"I've been sampling as many sugar-free chocolates as I can find.  This one was okay but not the best.  I don't think what I got was the freshest either, as it had some of that white coating on a portion of the bar.  The BEST I've found so far is Cavalier brand at another website."
3,"I had been using Green Mountain MILK Hot Chocolate, which is good (my kids love it), but weak for a true chocoholic like myself. I thought since I like dark chocolate in general, I would try the DARK Hot Chocolate. Thankfully, I only bought a small quantity because it has a really nasty after taste to it that lingers. I'm going to stick with my weak milk hot chocolate and just make a smaller cup."
1,"This was a pretty good idea -- it's basically juice from concentrate that's been reconstituted with sparkling instead of plain water. As such, it's about as sweet and flavorful as regular juice. The sparkling water gives it a little different sort of fizz from regular soda's. Although these cans are only about 2/3 the size of regular soda cans, it's relatively filling and a single can makes for a decent drink. Sure, it has a fair amount of sugar, but it's not a diet product. And for most people, it's better to drink the natural sugar in fruit juice than the chemicals in most sodas.<br /><br />There are two problems: the price and the flavors. At nearly a dollar a can, even when purchased by the case, this is expensive stuff. One could simply buy some juice and some sparkling water and make a fair approximation without spending so much. The other issue is the fact that the recipe contains more apple and grape juice than kiwi or cherry juice. This isn't uncommon for juices made from expensive fruits, but in this case it's really noticeable.  However, it's less noticeable than it was in the Switch Black Cherry flavor -- the kiwi definitely stands out.  (If you're deciding between the two, go with Kiwi Berry.)  If you don't like apple or grape juice, that could be enough to ruin this drink for you."
0,"This tea is awesome, and also way cheaper from amazon than from the official website. All my friends that try it are hooked."
1,"I purchased this carbonated lemonade at a local health food store on a whim and I love it.  I've had Mediterranean rose water lemonade before which I liked but it did not have ginger root nor was it carbonated which adds a lot of zing.  Also, this lemondade is botanically brewed and has distilled essential oil of rose.  The rose oil seems to bring out layers or dimensions of flavor from the lemon and the ginger.  It's very refreshing and very unique!<br /><br />Ingredients are as follows:<br />Carbonated Water, Lemon Juice Concentrate, Cane Sugar, Glucose Syrup, Fermented Ginger Root Extracts (ginger root, water and yeast), Pear Juice Concentrate, Lemon Flavoring, Citric Acid, Tantaric Acid, Natural Color (grape skin extract), and Rose Oil.<br /><br />The Fentimans Victorian Rose Lemonade isn't cheap, but it's worth it for a treat.  Definitely a more sophisticated ""soda"" for the less processed palate (Sprite and Mountain Dew lovers need not apply - lol - you may not like it!).  It adds so much to a meal... even as a dessert!"
1,"Great alternative to soda and aspartame/spenda sweetened drinks.  This has really helped me dramatically cut back on my diet soda intake.  This uses all natural color, flavor and sweeteners and is plenty sweet.  At 30 calories per 16 oz, it is still relatively low calorie.  I usually mix a packet with 24 oz and it is sweet enough for me."
1,When I first took a sip it is a shock to the taste buds as this is 100% fruit juice with carbonation.  I liked it chilled and it did taste like a soda from the bubbles yet not as sweet (syrupy) as a soda since there is NO added sugar. It is a healthy alternative to sodas and my kids loved it too. This was a great flavor since we love strawberry and the kiwi flavor added a twist. Genius product!
1,"The switch is a nice change from soda pop, and a great alternative for children."
0,"For anyone who is a seasoned Sencha tea drinker, this is tea is a total dud.  It barely tastes anything like fresh, high quality Sencha nor even older dried sencha leaves.  I had to throw this in the trash because it's simply dreadful."
1,"I didn't like this drink at all! It had a very strange, almost chemically taste to it. I also didn't appreciate Switch marketing itself as ""all-natural"" but had ingredients like ""natural flavors and colors"". What are they?? Are they even natural?? I even let my three year old try it but she couldn't even swallow it and spit it out in the sink. Too bad. It would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste. My daughter and I much prefer the OOba Hibiscus drink."
1,"Like many others, I found The Switch Orange Tangerine to be a little hard to classify. It's not too sweet, and not too tart, with a lot of flavor. But it distinctly tastes ""blended"" - creating a ""real"" flavor by playing with others.<br /><br />It doesn't really claim to be healthy, it just insinuates it in a number of ways. On the other hand, it's not too overly sweet like a typical soda and I found the carbonation was just about right.<br /><br />Bottom line - it's fairly tasty, but the small size for the price is a downside."
0,I have a serious green tea addiction and I'm always looking to explore different flavour profiles and various additions to the wonder that is green tea; this didn't disappoint. The brown rice comes through with it's nutty flavour but doesn't overpower the green tea. My only concern is that it will oversteep and get bitter pretty easily and anything over about 2 minutes is too much as opposed to other brands I've tried and it only deepens the tea strength. Otherwise it's a great start to my mornings!
1,"I thought this would have a similar taste to another brand of carbonated juice on the market, called Izze, that has fewer calories, tastes better and costs less. However, Switch has a weird artificial aftertaste. It tastes like a blend between orange juice and orange soda, but not in a good way. Also, with 140 calories per serving (8.3 ounces) and 34 grams of sugar, you might as well drink soda- because this beverage it not any healthier and certainly not cheaper."
3,I have tried a few of the cocoa cups and find this product about average.  Unless you stir the cup the cocoa will taste watery for a few sips.
0,"This is a dual review, as it has to be.  The first part covers the delicious, needs-nothing-else China Mist iced tea varieties included in this box.  Each of 24 packets contains four ounces of the world's choicest tea leaves, with stellar flavorings mixed in (dried, crushed mango; dried, crushed passion fruit; dried, crushed raspberry; pure, strong tea).<br /><br />My first experience with it was at a restaurant where our daughter works.  She said, Order the iced tea, Dad, you won't need to put any sugar or lemon or anything into it (always looking out for my diabetes).  It was fantastic, nearly the highlight of my meal, which itself was outstanding.  I asked the manager if he could share the tea secret:  Well, we use the industry's best, China Mist!  Everybody says it's the best they've had!  Indeed.<br /><br />The flavor was, if you'll pardon me, complex and could be rated as you would a nice wine--action, hints of this or that, a new rush at the end of your taste cycle.  It made me think what I'd been missing; this tasted like what the British must drink, the full-bodied teas they enjoy.  Apparently Americans add as much extra water to our tea as we do to our coffee (What the French hear when we order a java over there:  I'll have coffee, with a cup of water on top).<br /><br />The second part of the review concerns our Hamilton Beach iced tea machine.  We add the recommend water and ice cubes, and the brewing cycle indeed does take only 10 minutes.  The tea is already ice cold.  It may be the difference between a home-level heat limit, or maybe the fact that the water is not ""pressured"" over the tea as much as it might be in a commercial machine, or maybe the commercial machines are much better insulated around the steeping container.  Our Hamilton Beach unit made a weaker tea than I would have liked; we'll reduce the amount of water from now on and see what that does.  In fairness, the Bamilton Beach Iced Tea make was $22.49; commercial models are $600 or more, but they brew their stronger teas in only 8 (versus 10) minutes.  A wildly expensive two minutes."
4,"My two Siberian cats refused almost a dozen canned foods, but THIS, they could not get enough of!  Thank you!  A superb supplement to their dry food diet."
0,"I have fallen in love with this tea. I am a british tea fanatic and Ashby's has superceded my tastes and expectations. Smooth, not to bitter, low tannins awesome taste! I'll take this over PG Tips!"
4,"My cats go crazy for the Party Mix and mainly the cheese flavor. It sells for $1.50<br />to $1.89 a pouch in my local stores, so I was looking on amazon hoping to find a better<br />price. I looked at this listing because of the price of $6.48, assuming it was for several<br />pouches, like most of the other listings here. But no number of pouches was listed and the<br />only indication comes from looking at the shipping weight: this ia apparently the price<br />for a single pouch. This is a problem with amazon--quantities are not always posted<br />and you can really get ripped off overpaying. I saw one review for Friskies canned<br />food, where the reviewer thought she was ordering a multican pack for $12 but the<br />actual number was not posted and she ended up receiving ONE can!"
2,I was kinda worried at first how the kids were going to react. They loved them and couldnt get enough. They were just as described and very yummy! Great product!
2,Very yummy!  My kids and I loved it!  Cute story on the box too!
3,"I love Stephens Chocolate Raspberry. It is the best I've ever had. Other brands I've tried were bitter and just not as tasty.<br />It stirs in smooth, no lumps.<br />My order arrived quickly, just as promised. I'm a very happy consumer of this product and the supplier."
1,"Who knew juice could be so cool? It has a very refreshing taste and lightness, just the right amount of sweet (not too much). Switch is an apt name for this beverage. I am guessing that lots of folks will be making the ""switch"" from cola to ""carbonated juice"" once they get a taste of this product line."
3,"Stephen's is absolutely the BEST hot chocolate I have ever tasted!  It is so creamy and delicious.  Every flavor I've ever tried is excellent.  My whole family loves it.  I don't know any stores in the area that sell it, so we are thrilled to be able to order it through Amazon."
3,"For the price you pay and size of each cup (you can really only make the smallest size) you are getting taken with this purchase. Buy the traditional mix from any other company, you will get a better value, better taste and a richer texture. This snot a horrible mix, it tastes ok, but it is nothing more than a decent cup of chocolate flavored water. It has no thickness to it. Swiss Miss or any other grocery store hot chocolate beats it hands down.<br />All you are getting with this is convenience of using K-cups, which is not much of one to begin with.<br />Avoid it."
1,"Though it is a bit expensive, this juice with carbonation has a very sweet, somewhat tangy taste. It is a little too sweet for me.<br /><br />This is my favorite fruit juice combination. This is the only flavor of this ""soda"" I've tried as well.<br /><br />Because of the price I'm not sure if I'd buy this or just continue using my juicer.<br /><br />Another issue is that it is very high in calories.<br /><br />I believe this is a high quality drink and would recommend it highly."
0,"I bought this tea for my dad, who loves tea. The irish breakfast tea is his favorite for the very strong tea it makes."
0,We came across this tea at PF Chang's China Bistro a few years back.  This flavor has became our favorite blend of tea.  It does well as hot or iced tea.
3,"I tried Stephen's Chocolate Mint truffle hot chocolate mix at a Church function and it was wonderful, I had to get some."
1,"i have started the extraction process less than a month ago, and so far it looks and smell wonderful. waiting to try it.i have put 6 oz in 1.75 liters of vodka and now have a beautiful brown fluid that as i stated earlier smells wonderful. I plan on using the other 2 oz. in some homemade vanilla frozen icecream etc."
1,"It's a small drink at just 8.3 ounces but that's probably the size drink we should all be consuming so I wont ding it on that point. It's made with good ingredients and as it says `No Sugar Added' but don't let that fool you into thinking it's low in sugar having 34 grams. A Coke contains 45g of sugar but it's almost 50% larger so even without adding sugar this is a drink that's fully loaded. In defense of The Switch at least the sugar is natural with no high fructose corn syrup. Obviously it has no caffeine which I have some issues with so that's a plus over soda although at 36g of carbs it seems a bit high and 140 calories is nothing to sneeze at.<br /><br />So it can't be considered a health drink since you can get lower sugar, carbs and calories from a similar size glass of Tropicana orange juice. So how is the taste? My wife described it as tasting like soap. I wouldn't go that far but I will say the despite its good ingredients it actually tasted artificial to me. I wasn't a big fan and personally I'm going to stick with water and orange juice.... and beer."
2,"The earths best he eats the most, this one is a little thicker than his original chicken/sweet potato favorite which is very runny."
4,"I've been on the hunt for high quality cat food that doesn't cost a fortune. After a lot of research at various sites Petguard was one on my list to try, so I ordered a case from amazon and couldn't be happier. 2/3 of my cats LOVE it, the 3rd cat is a dry food addict and I'm in the process of trying to convert her but it's slow going. Be warned though, this stuff smells terrible, opening a can and dishing it out is like being slapped in the face with a week old mackerel, but that's how cats like it.<br /><br />Bottom line this food is reasonably priced and high quality. It has low carbs, low ash/magnesium, high protein, real human grade meat with no by-products, the vitamins/minerals are chelated for better absorption and Petguard has stated they do not use BPA lined cans. Also, contrary to what the ingredient list here on Amazon says it does NOT contain ""Menadione Sodium Bisulfite"" or at least the case I ordered doesn't have any listed, so they must have stopped using it, which is a big plus."
0,"I chose to have this tea sent to me automatically, thereby saving even more money.  It's cheaper this way than I can buy at my local store.  Loose tea made with filtered water makes the absolute best tasting iced tea!"
0,"This is some really nice tea.  Even brewed slightly weak, the flavor comes through.  The scent will fill your whole house and just make everything seem a little bit better.  If you like Earl Grey, this is definately a brand to give a try."
2,I got a few different flavors of the HAPPYBABY food and this one in particular causes my daughter to gag and vomit. My daughter does not have a weak stomach by any means and eats a lot of different foods. But for whatever reason when she eats this flavor it comes right back out. After the third try I am giving up and concluding there is something wrong with this item.<br /><br />Even more disappointed that there is no option to return it with Amazon. I did however reach out to HAPPYBABY directly and are working with them to make this purchase a positive experience. For that I have changed my review from 1 stars to 3 stars.<br /><br />For now I will stick with the Chick Chick and Gobble Gobble flavors!
0,"Ingredients listed: Pure cane sugar, and 100% pure powdered Japanese green tea.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts: all 0%, except Sodium (15mg) and Sugar (12g)<br /><br />Basic Instructions: add one packet to 8oz of cold water and stir or shake well to dissolve...<br /><br />My Opinion: It is too sweet for my taste, even diluted in a 16.9oz water bottle. It almost tastes like sugar water. I think the unsweetened version would be better. 5 star because it delivers what it promises.<br /><br />This is Japanese green tea. NOT Chinese green tea. There is a difference."
1,"I loved it! Good taste, pleasant carbonation, fun can.<br /><br />Ok, so all it is is carbonated fruit juice.... big deal, right?  But it actually is a big deal if you are a soda junky and want to cut down on the negative effects without losing all the experience.  I hate diet soda because it just doesn't taste right and has way too many synthetic chemicals in it. However, this drink has no sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives. I suppose the CO2 may not be the best for you, but you gotta live a little."
1,"I really liked this drink.  It provides the pleasure of a carbonated beverage without the sickly-sweet, sticky feeling that drinking a soda leaves behind.  Despite containing apple and grape juice, it tastes mainly like the orange and tangerine it advertises.  If you're looking for a carbonated juice, I'd definitely suggest this.  I'll be drinking it again."
4,"I ordered this because it is Science Diet and it says it is minced. Well, it is NOT minced and my cats do not like it. It is more of a pate than minced and gets mashed down in their bowl so they can't eat it. I am very unhappy with this product and my cats are too. Will not be buying it again. Returning it would be not worth it as the shipping charges are taken out of the balance so I would be losing money."
2,Even my kids like this. They are always asking for hot cocoa. Its not too sweet and very chocolaty. It is not super high in sugar or calories so its a great little treat. Enjoy!
2,My daughter loves these snacks and so does everyone else. I try to feed my daughter organic stuff and I'm so glad that Earth's Best makes a variety of snacks that she can have.
2,"I love this gerber item!!  My son is 6 months old and is a bit particular.  He spits out most veggies, except sweet potatoes of course, and even a lot of fruits, unless I mix them with cereal to thicken them up a bit!  He loves the thick texture of this food!!!  So from a frustrated mommy, this is a great thing!!!  If your child is refusing green beans or sweet peas, give this a try!  Its got enough texture to please my babe, it may be your favorite too!!"
0,Fennel tea is the best herbal tea I have been able to find and Seelect is the best-tasting brand of those I have tried.
2,"My 9 mo. old daughter only eats earth's best products and loves all of them - that is, except this. I can't figure out what it is, but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood. I tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites. I gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else's child would like it. I have had a good experience with the ""subscribe and save"" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons). This is the only flavor of earth's best baby food that my daughter dislikes. For what it's worth, I suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first."
0,"I had tried this tea in bags before.  I prefer leaf tea.  When the local shop ran out of Irish Breakfast tea, I tried this instead.  Very good flavor that recalls UK trips.  I would recommend this tea to anyone."
1,"It really is!  I am not a fan of carbonated drinks because most of them are simply not healthy.  I even know people who have developed physical problems because of too much consumption of them, especially those who even drink them as a starter in the morning.<br /><br />BUT THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT. It has a real full-bodied orange/ tangerine flavor, although the label says it is combined with other juice concentrates:  apple, grape and acerola juice (I had to look that one up:  it is the cherrylike fruit of a small tree of the West Indies which has a high concentration of vitamin C).  Anyway, it's just darned good!<br /><br />I experimented a little on the best way to serve.  I drank it cold as is, then poured it over a glass of ice cubes.  Neither of those ways seemed quite right.  Then I poured the beverage on ice, left it for a minute, then removed the ice by pouring juice through a strainer.  This left it nice and chilled, not just cold, and not weakened by melting ice.<br /><br />I live in the Colorado Desert where temperatures are scorching in the summers.  Orange juice doesn't quite quench my almost constant thirst, but has been the best thing available to me until now.  Yes, I will definitely SWITCH TO SWITCH, forgive the pun!<br /><br />It's actually good for you too.  Hope one day it will be in ALL schools."
4,"I can't sleep past 6 AM anymore because of this food.  One of my cats sits on my face, attempting to suffocate me into consciousness (cats aren't very good at biology..), while the other kneads every bare spot of flesh he can find with his claws of ""love"" until I get up.  If I stop in the bathroom between stumbling out of bed and into the kitchen, I'm treated to a rousing refrain of ""MROW MROW SCRATCH YOWL"" outside of the door--and that's if they don't follow me into the bathroom and circle around my legs like they're caught in my gravitational pull, all the while insisting can opening is a far better use of my thumbs than anything else.<br /><br />The only cons, really.  And they're cute cons, so I let it slide.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, my cats love this stuff.  They eat it, rocket around the house for 45 minutes like they've just done some meth (oh, the power of organic ingredients!), then collapse in the sunspot on my vacated bed and sleep until I get home from work.<br /><br />Cat win?  I think so."
1,"Didn't realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-. Gave it away the next day at work."
3,"Real Mexican chocolate of any version will be much better than mass produced American chocolate simply because the cocoa content is much higher (as w/ European chocolate). This is REAL dark chocolate w/ a little spice and sugar. I do not think it requires any additional sugar when I make it since I want the dark chocolate flavor. I use a whisk and it comes out delicious. I think this is one of the best products Nestle makes and about the only one I consistently purchase. In fact I'm going to try the powder mix version for convenience, but since the chocolate will be further processed, it probably won't be as good. However, it also received positive reviews."
1,"My baby loves this flavor of Gerber juice. I dilute 4 oz of this juice with equal amounts of water and let her drink it with meals. In between, I let her have plain water. These 4 oz are equal to a serving of fruit, which I really like. It is MUCH cheaper to buy this in bulk in this size than buying the small 4 oz bottles. Would definitely recommend."
1,"I love Crystal Light. My mom used to give it to me when I was a kid, instead of buying sodas. I didn't drink it for a long time and when I saw this I bought it as an alternative to buying diet sodas. Let me just say, DELICIOUS!!!! I make sure my water is absolutely cold before I mix in the crystal light and it is SOOOOO refreshing. My favorite is the wild strawberry. It reminds me of the strawberries my mom used to grow. I'm going to buy three more of these. Hopefully it will last me till the summer but I doubt it."
0,The product was received on schedule and in perfect condition. I have been buying this product and brewing it for years and it is still a great product.  It is much better tasting than using tea bags.
1,"I am a die hard soda pop fan. I will drink juice but normally only certain brands or with a little soda (7up or Sprite) mixed in to kill the after-taste and to sweeten it up a bit.<br /><br />Well this is better that even that mix without the bad stuff from the soda. It has a crisp, clean orange taste with a nice tangerine undertone that continues through the after-taste. It is effortless to drink and doesn't make you feel sluggish afterwords. It is hard to describe other than to say they got it right. No extra sugar, yet it is very sweet, but not too sweet.<br /><br />I shared my can with my wife and she agreed with my comments 100%. We both we were sad that we only got the one little can to review and not the entire case!<br /><br />While I am not sure it could replace my Coke, it sure could replace my juice and some of my coke intake. The only problem (there always seems to be something) is that it is about 4 times the cost of my coke per oz. I could justify twice the cost but four times is the only reason I haven't ordered more so far. I do expect to breakdown and buy a case, but I still won't be happy over the cost difference."
1,"This cherry juice concentrate taste very cherry :-)  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032JKWGI"">Country Spoon Montmorency Red Tart Cherry Juice Concentrate 34 oz.</a> I like this product, and, perhaps, I will order this cherry juice concentrate again."
0,"As an ex-Brit. steeped (pun intended!) in strong black tea, I wasn't sure about this, but Revolution White Pomegranate tea is absolutely delicious, light yet flavorful.  The low caffeine content makes it ideal for an evening pot of tea and of course,iced tea. I hesitated to recommend it in case you run out of it!"
0,I wasn't much of a tea drinker until I bought a 'Breville' automatic tea maker and a bag of Tummy Tea Fennel for my wife. She started brewing the first pot of this new tea and did it ever smell great- a little like licorice. We both shared that pot and have been hooked ever since. This is one of those teas that makes you just feel warm and fuzzy all over. It is a feeling you do not forget.  If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have one tea this would be it.<br /><br />  For those who enjoy drinking tea I would encourage you to look into the 'Breville' tea maker. Produced by a German firm it is without a doubt an indispensible tool for brewing tea. The price for this mechanical marvel is a little high but believe me it is worth every penny.
2,"My kids & I love these, they are like rice krispie treats but not as sweet, similar texture and a great snack."
0,"The lavender flavor is not found everywhere, and works well in tea or coffee.<br />I like to add true vanilla extract as a base flavor."
1,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but upon tasting it (very chilled), I have to admit, it's pretty darn tasty!<br /><br />To give you an idea of what it tastes like:  Take orange juice.  Give it the familiar ""bite"" of your favorite carbonated beverage.  Add a little tangerine for a slight citrus aftertaste, and there you go.  Basically, it looks and smells like orange juice, but it tastes like orange pop *should* taste, if it really tasted like oranges.  My wife said it reminded her of Minute Maid orange pop (or, as she would call it, orange *soda*).<br /><br />Our four-year-old son is eager to drink pop because he sees mom and dad do it occassionally, but we generally don't let him.  After reading the nutritional information on the can and seeing that there's no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, or artificial flavors, I can admit that I would have no problem letting him drink this instead of juice occassionally (but not *too* often, as it is quite a bit of sugar!).<br /><br />My wife made the observation that this drink would probably make a fantastic mixer for adult beverages.  Sadly, the sample we received was not enough to test this theory, but it should make a really, really good screwdriver."
0,"I would often have Fauchon and Hediard earl grey tea when I lived in Japan.<br />But here in the USA, they cannot be found anywhere. However, I'm really satisfied with this Rishi earl grey. It tastes as good as Fauchon and Hediard and the price is only half. It is highly recommended."
4,My cat had periodental disease. He had to have teeth removed. This dental diet helps keep his teeth and gums healthy.
2,"I've been buying this milk hot chocolate for months now and it's one of the best I've had.  I even got my in-laws hooked on it and my granddaughters absolutely love it!  Great price, great product!"
4,"As the ingredients contained in this food are not the optimal food sources essential to a cat's well being, I don't actually feed my cats this dry food.<br /><br />Corn is the first ingredient, which is a food my cats really don't crave.  There is a meat source as the second ingredient, but unfortunately, it is a by-product.  Although there are a couple of other meat sources listed in the ingredients, the addition of artificial preservatives and coloring make this cat food a less than desirable food staple for any cat.<br /><br />However, the Amazon price is good and with Amazon prime 2-day free shipping directly to work, this is a very convenient food for the shop cats I feed.  While the ingredients aren't the best, feeding it along with canned food, it is a balanced diet and seems to keep the shop cats healthy."
2,"The Happy Baby Chick Chick is delicious and my baby loves it.  It's a hearty puree, not so runny.  It's got little pea sized pieces of chicken and pasta in it which she loves to gum on.  It smells good and tastes good.  I like that it's organic and wholesome."
3,Excellent product! A tip from the Keurig people: shake the K-cup before using it. This prevents the cocoa from clumping and results in more flavor.
0,This is the best Earl Grey I've found. I've tried about 15 - 20 different brands. I like that it's also organic and fair trade.
1,"I was offered the opportunity to taste this product because of Vine. I would not normally purchase this type of product, so my review and opinion will be biased in that regard.<br /><br />I'm not a big soda drinker, I'd just rather drink water or coffee. I will occasionally drink a diet soft drink, usually Diet Pepsi or Diet Coke.<br /><br />Did you know that a single 12oz can of Coke Classic® has 140 calories and 39 grams of sugar? This 8oz can of Switch has 140 calories and 34grams of sugar. And this is healthy? 4 ounces less is size, same caloric content and more sugar per ounce that Classic Coke. OK, so it's not ""added"" sugar, but still, that's a lot of sugar. 100% Orange juice, 8 oz, has 120 calories and 28 grams of sugar.<br /><br />The can says it is ""Orange Tangerine"" but in fact the contents are #1: Water #2: Concentrates of Apple, Grape, Tangerine, Orange, and Acerola juices. Then they throw in some ""gum acacia"", ""natural flavors and colors"" and some ""ascorbic acid(vitamin C)"". And as a little surprise bonus, they have added ""soy"". Soy?<br /><br />I asked my wife to taste this product with me. I poured the drink into two glasses and we both took a sip. Her reaction was swift and strong... she hated it. I agreed with her. It was for me, sickly sweet and left a sugary aftertaste in my mouth. Not only that, but the taste was just nasty. It didn't taste at all like orange or tangerine to me. It just tasted terribly sweet with an undefined cirtus something taste. The carbonation did not add anything positive to the experience. Neither of us finished drinking our 4oz portion. It went down the sink.<br /><br />I would not purchase this product in the future and if I could have given it 0-stars, I would have. It's that bad."
0,Purchased this tea because of recommendation. Product arrived well packaged and quickly. I am very pleased with this product and will purchase it again.
1,"This product label says that it is ""the perfect balance between juice and carbonation"", but I think the maunfacturer still needs to reduce the carbonation further. Also, I tried a couple of other flavors beside this kiwi/berry, and they are all mostly apple, grape, and acerola with a hint of other things. This particular item is called ""Kiwi Berry"", but there is NO kiwi fruit even listed on the ingredient panel. It is true that no corn syrup has been added, but there are still high sugars. For only 8.3 ounces of liquid, we are drinking 135 empty calories;however, this is a high level of vitamin C. Also, children will probably like these really sweet flavors, so this could be an alternative to offer the little ones."
1,"The flavor combination of kiwi, and strawberry is quite tasty.  With no sugar added, this gourmet soda keeps just the right amount of sweetness about itself.  Each can is only 8.5 Fl Oz (245 mL) - so in my mind it is rather pricey."
3,"Is this hot chocolate....yes<br />Is this good hot chocolate....um, sorta<br />Is this gourmet hot chocolate....not a chance.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only advantage you get but using the Green Mountain K-cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your Keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove-top. Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery.<br /><br />Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this.<br /><br />3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if you're looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping."
4,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."
1,"I am not one for ""canned"" juice drinks, but this one was exceptional in flavor. I am also not a big fan of orange flavored drinks but the tangerine is distinctive and nice.  It kind of reminded me of one of my favorite soft drinks in the world, Ting (from Jamaica) which is made from real grapefruit juice. Very nice, if you need more Vitamin C in your life I would consider buying it."
0,"Added 2-hours later: I am buzzing! There's caffein in that tea!<br /><br />ADDED 102308: Just made a big pitcher of iced tea (it's 83°F here in Moss Beach! That's HOT, for us) with this tea. The aroma is unbelievable... flowery, spicy... and the flavor is quite good... Earl Grey with a kick. YUM.<br /><br />OK. The smell and taste of this is Earl Grey tea... what do you expect? The selling point is the organic, fair trade aspect. Also, the elimination of the middle-man, but I'd have to review the books before I'd believe that. I am fortunate enough to be in a situation where I can afford to support these important principles. If you are too, then buy this instead of non-organic, non-fair trade.<br />Hmm, after previewing I tried to change my star rating to 5... I mean, it's the principle of the thing... but I was not able to."
2,"My son isn't a particularly picky eater but occasionally he gets fussy.  No matter what his mood is, this is a great meal option to fall back on because he'll always eat it.  Also the pouch sturdy and makes it a good travel-meal option.  A little expensive but worth every penny!"
2,"15 month old loves to eat them on the go! They seem great for a healthy, quick, and easy snack!"
0,"Pros:<br />- Extremely fragrant<br />- Full bodied<br />- Can be steeped twice<br />- Nice air-tight container<br />- Organic<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Price<br /><br />The Tao of Tea, Blue Flower Earl Grey Black Tea is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted, and I would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPFGO"">The Tao of Tea, Blue Flower Earl Grey Black Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>"
3,"Unlike the other hot chocolate(s), this one does not have that obnoxious after taste.  What a relief.  When I purchased my Keurig it came with a box of 16 hot chocolate K-Cups (name not used to protect the guilty), that have the most indescribable, particularly unpleasant after taste, all due to the ""fake"" sugar that seems to comprise most if not all of the product.<br /><br />This manufacturer does use some sucralose, but no where near the amount that ""other"" uses.  In fact, it actually tastes like hot chocolate during and after the sipping.  WhooHoo!!!!<br /><br />Will be ordering more - Thank You for my Kuerig hot chocolate reaffirmation."
2,I wanted to try these prunes and was truly suprised at the taste they imparted. They are semi-sweet with a fruity perfume like aroma. The reason I gave them 4 stars is that they have a fairly large pit and it does take care in eating them. Caution: this is not a small child food!!
1,"Switch certainly lives up to its name - it is definitely a switch from your normal drinks. Packaged like an energy drink, the Kiwi Berry Switch almost has the texture of a soda, and almost tastes like a sweetened fruit juice. Its a little of both, and actually manages to pull it off.<br /><br />Some people might find the drink a bit too sweet, but I found that the excessive sweetness wasn't accompanied by a lingering aftertaste, or a sticky, sugary residue that just makes you thirstier. It actually is quite refreshing, which is remarkable for a drink which almost tastes like liquid candy.<br /><br />The kiwi part of this kiwi berry drink it almost nonexistent, but the berry flavor almost makes you forget this. The size of the can is the perfect portion size for a drink of this nature; you wouldn't want to drink too much of this in one sitting. But the serving size is perfect for a taste of something sweet and refreshing."
3,"I ordered the hot cocoa for my grandson for Christmas.  He loves the flavor and is able to make it on his own.  Delivery was good, I had it in several days but still in plenty of time for Christmas.  Would recommend to anyone."
0,"I love this tea.  It is my favorite ever.  I first bought a box when vacationing on Maui, then couln't find it at any of my local stores when we got home, so had to order it online.  I would no doubt drink this tea exclusively if not for the reviewer who thinks it almost killed him!"
1,"I have to admit, I liked the watermelon strawberry flavor better than this one, kiwi berry, but this was just as flavorful and just as pleasant. Just the right amount of carbonation and sweetness, and I really loved the fact this has no corn syrup or refined sugar. The small can size is also very handy because it's easy to slip into a bag and it's exactly one serving size. As I mentioned with the other flavor, this drink doesn't have a weird aftertaste or leave a lingering flavor on the tongue--it's very clean and refreshing."
0,"This tea was supposed to be loose tea.  I purchase loose tea all the time.  Instead of packaging the tea in bags, they left it loose.  Gave a very couldy tea with a bitter taste."
1,"I tried both the Watermelon Strawberry and the Kiwi Berry drinks.  I found the taste to be light, not overly sweet, and quite refreshing.  With the 8.3 oz size there was no waste with leftover juice in a can going flat!  I would love to have this in a zero to very low calorie version, tho."
0,"The tea is absolutely delicious. It's a bit expensive, but if you like tea a lot then this is a very good purchase to make! It's my new favorite tea =)"
3,We bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then Cafe Escapes dark chocolate.  It was also thinner in consistency. Won't buy again
0,"Cracking the tin gave the first indication that this as a different Earl Grey. The tin aroma was a 'bright' citrus as opposed the the usual 'darker, earthier' citrus I have encountered with other Earl Greys. I don't know if it's a different strain of bergamot, if it's processed differently, but the nose is almost tangerine-like in its brightness.<br /><br />The nose translates well to the flavor, though the bergamot difference is less obvious here.  I found the balance to be good, though I've noticed that it seems to get unusually tannic/bitter with just slight oversteeping,(so watch that brew time closely.)<br /><br />I think I'm going to have to investigate more of Rishi's products.<br /><br />Recommended"
0,"I think I'm not a green tea drinker.  This is pretty awful tasting stuff.  Glad I bought just one bag, because I'm throwing it out."
1,"This is a very dangerous product. It is not labeled as to identify ""Pepsin: A name for several enzymes secreted by the stomach to break down protein; An enzyme produced in the stomach that splits proteins into peptones; Also used as coagulant, comes from the stomach of the pigs; An enzyme from pigs' stomachs, used with rennet to make cheese."" I flushed my money down the toilet - don't be fooled by the Pure Fun Organic Candy Pepsin Swirl Mint Pinwheels - These are horrid and made me sick. I allowed a 7 year old to have one (thinking it was exactly as the package was labeled) CANDY. Stay away from Pepsin Swirl which in my opinion is fraud and the FDA needs to investigate this product."
1,"Firstly, I hate orange flavored sodas. They all taste like ultra-fake chemical laden floor cleaner to me.  Switch is definitely NOT the case.  Finally an orange soda that tastes like real oranges and tangerines- who knew!  I thoroughly enjoyed this fizzy delight, which reminded me of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E3HLX6"">San Pellegrino Aranciata Sparking Beverage - 24/11.5 oz cans</a> but sweeter.  This, and ALL Switch beverages are highly recommended."
0,"My first taste of this tea saved my trip home from Santa Cruz, when both the hotel and a restaurant had stale powder in the tea bags.  How I needed my fix!  A tourist stop with a giant artichoke beckoned, and this Chinese Breakfast / Yunnan Black Tea set me straight.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said it tastes odd.  The flavor is strong and a bit smoky, like Darjeeling, only earthier.  Like Darjeeling or Earl Grey, it has enough flavor on its own -- no milk or sugar needed.  But it's expensive by the box of teabags.  Finding it loose in large quantities at this price is fantastic!  It arrived promptly, well-sealed, and true to the label -- unlike some ""loose"" tea that's actually cut up, this has the whole leaves that unfurl.  Ahhh."
4,"My cat looked at it, smelled it for a minute or so, took one bite and ran away.  She would not touch it after that.  We donated the rest of the shipment to a shelter.  Hopefully some cats there will like it.  The only thing I can get my cat to eat is Fancy Feast.  I have tried all the organic and grain free brands and she won't touch any of them.  She is an indoor/outdoor cat that we adoted as a one year old who was stray.  I think the only meat she likes besides fancy feast is fresh kill.  If you know some healthy brands that your fussy cat has enjoyed, please write a review or email me if that is an option."
2,The variety pack is the way to go when buying in bulk. My 9-month old daughter loves all of the flavors.
3,"I like this hot cocoa very much it has a very rich taste compared to the others I have tried.Just bought some more of these.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q1VI"">Grove Square Single Serve Hot Cocoa Cups, Milk, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count</a>A+++!!!!cocoa!"
4,"My cats love freeze dried meats.<br />They absolutely love these treats.<br />They are the cheapest of all the treats I buy.<br />The quality is good, too many small pieces though.<br /><br />Do not buy freeze dried beef liver as it is too hard on there tummies.<br /><br />I only give them a couple of pieces a day but they know what time that is!"
1,"I enjoyed this drink. It has good fizz and flavor. Ingredients include apple/grade juices as the main fruit elements. Tangerine, orange and acerola (type of wild cherry) round out the other fruit juices. For my taste, this is not citrusy enough. I find an Orangina to have better flavor, but it is loaded with added sugars (high fructose corn syrup is the second ingredient in Orangina)! I also compare this to the Izze version and the Izze wins for flavor. I think the health benefits of The Switch or Izze drinks outweigh the flavor differences though, and if I was but one of these types of drinks, I would not look at Orangina again."
0,"Pricey, if you didn't read the side of the tin. These sachets are to be brewed with TWO cups of water, not one. Therefore, you are getting 40 cups of tea with this tin. Hands down the best tea I've ever tasted. I like mine with a pinch of sugar or honey and cream. Just wish it was cheaper on Amazon, I get it at Woodman's Market for $5, every time, no price fluctuation like Amazon. I have a real sweet tooth and this replaces my late-night urge to binge on chocolate. You will not be disappointed with this tea what-so-ever!"
4,"With a cat that had to have a special diet housed with 3 other cats that did not, this product worked out perfectly. They all like it so I could keep feeding free choice as I had done before. All showed improvement as well but especially the cat that required it. Excellent size for my feeding demands. I am getting ready to order again."
3,"Grove Square is the best k-cup hot cocoa I've tried.  And I've tried a number of the other brands.  This tastes like ""real"" cocoa used to taste. And if you add a little milk it's even better. It's so hot from the Keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway. If your looking for a real chocolate-ly flavor give this a try."
2,"Finally! The perfect snack for my little one! My two year old absolutely LOVES these! He's constantly asking for ""bueberries!"" I used to give him concentrated gummy fruit snacks for a treat, but now he only wants Little Ducks snacks. This of course thrills me! The snacks are 100% certified organic, healthy fruit - just freeze dried. I'm happy to give him as many fruit servings as he wants. You definitely will love this product! The other flavors are great too..."
1,"Here we have a refreshing drink, not one you'd want to drink three of in a row but just one for a picker-upper or to quench an urgent thirst.<br /><br />The flavor (orange-tangerine) is subject to peoples' personal tastes but I liked it okay. It's not the best drink I've ever tried but it's okay for something different. People will have to make their own choice as to whether to buy it or not in regard to the price.<br /><br />Unfortunately, either the manufacturer, the Amazon Vine people, or both, goofily (is there such a word...? if not, I just invented it) placed two useless stickers on the can which covered half of the nutrition facts on the can. There was plenty of space to put them elsewhere but some non-thinker failed to use his or her marketing sense. So all I can tell you on that topic is that there is a 1% sodium content, total carbs are 30 grams, and there are 140 calories per 8.3 ounce serving (1 can.)<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this product but that's chiefly because I normally drink only non-sugar beverages."
2,Bought these for my grandbabies and they love them. I love them because they are organic. Only the best for my little guys. My big guys even snack on them.
1,The product says a twist because of carbonation. Well after pouring the drink over 3 pieces of ice the carbonation was gone.  The carbonation is definitely light and does not last.<br /><br />As far as the taste goes I did not care for the taste at all. It left a bad after taste in my mouth I cannot recommend this product. I will stick with regular juice at a much lower cost.<br /><br />To be fair I gave it two stars because my wife thought it was OK.
0,I have been drinking the tea for about a year now. The product is fine.<br />My complaint is with the recent change on the individual tea bag envelope.<br />The new lavendar colored envelopes are impossible to open without the aid of scissors (or my teeth).<br />The previous two-tone envelopes tore open easily.<br />Please revert back.
0,"This is a quick & easy way to make green tea. It isn't sweet & only has the barest hint of blueberry, but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning. It does have more green tint to it than most teas- here's why: ""Sencha green tea comes from the Kyoto region of Japan. It is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea. Additionally, the color of the tea is actually green, not yellow, like many Chinese varieties."" Powdered tea is also good for cooking as well."
1,"Nice refreshing beverage but with 120 cal a bit too sweet.  Good amount of carbonation, though, so very cold it would be great for a summer picnick."
1,"What can i say??  They are wonderful, and the highlight of each weekend.  OHHHhhh  - use soda water for the liquid !  even better !!!"
0,"Lana's Snowflake Black Tea with Coconut and Almond has now become my favorite tea. First the smoothness is unbeatable. I found it a bit smoother than the Hanley Vanilla cormoro! Secondly,the aroma changes from the time you smell it in the bag and then brew, it is a great experience. When you taste it you have a wonderful surprise of sweetness and comfort. Sort of a nutty, caramel with vanilla notes, it is the PERFECT Dessert tea. My husband lost 18 lbs by drinking this instead of having ice cream! Now when you present it to friends,let them taste it first. If they go by the  intense aroma in the bag, it is so fresh some  have wrongly thought it was too strong a flavor, but it is not. It is the amazing  freshness they are not used to.  We served this at our wedding vow renewal and it beat out hanleys vanilla cormoro and Paris too.  This tea has filled a gap I have had in my collection, I have searched for a flavor like this over 3 years!!<br />Lana Please keep on creating this tea, I am definitely coming back for more.<br />And thank you for tremendous and fast service... btw, i am sipping this as i write.. YUM!<br />smiles, grace in VT"
1,"The flavor was great, the ingredients healthy.  This was a nice, natural energy drink that I would recommend over any soda or Red Bull-type product.  If you're looking for a carbonated beverage that isn't loaded with high fructose corn syrup, this is the way to go.  Highly recommended!"
3,I found this brand and the fact that it was dark chocolate made it by far the best I've had for my Keurig.  I will continue to order this particular brand.
0,"Both my husband and I drink tea every morning from a  pot. I wanted to get an organic, fair trade tea, but have been disappointed in the past.  After reading  the Amazon <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E20O"">Rishi Tea Organic Black Tea, Earl Grey Loose Tea, 3.3-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3)</a>reviews for this tea, Rishi Earl Grey organic, I thought I'd take a chance and buy the three pack.  We both loved the tea. We were drinkning the Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey tea, which we liked, but it wasn't organic.  This Rishi Earl Grey is similar in that it's not too perfumy of an Earl Grey. It really has a great flavor.  We both drink it with just milk.  I think that tea depends a lot on the water you use too.  We have well water and it's filtered.  Also the tin that the tea comes is has two lids, which keeps the tea fresher, longer.  Yum can't wait 'til morning."
3,The price is wonderful! The Hot cocoa tastes great in 6 and 8 oz but 10oz was a bit watery to me.<br />Dark Chocolate: YUM<br />Milk Chocolate: Is very yummy<br />Peppermint: For me wasn't enough peppermint but I just add a candy cane to mine.<br />  I would recommend this again and plan on ordering more soon!
0,"Tasteless, basically says it all.  I love tea.  Drink it every day.  I found this undrinkable.  Great packaging, but not a good tea for me."
0,"I love this tea.  I've researched the health benefits and it's one of the healthiest things you can drink... Google it.  I like that it's caffeine free, and with a little honey, it's a treat any time of day. I'll be buying more when I run out."
4,"We are Chocolate Moose & Mickey Moose,<br /><br />Our nice owner bought this great food for us.  We love it very much, I have gained 5 lbs. because I eat all of Mickey's food when he isn't looking!  Our skin and fur is much better now too.  :)"
2,SO CRUNCHIE GOOD!  HEALTHY ~ AND THE KIDS LOVE EM!  WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT IN A SNACK.  (BESIDES A 12-STEP PROGRAM TO STOP EATING THEM.)  THEY'RE FANTASTIC!!!
0,"I really enjoy this tea because it's not to sweet and it's easy to use.  I carry it and my mug with me and just add hot or cold water, depending upon my mood.  I find that it gives me just the right kind of energy and it can even hold my hunger between meals. A real great thing because I watch my calories.  And of course, green tea is full of antioxidants."
2,"We love Earth's best. Its hard to beat their variety of flavors and organic offerings. You can also buy a vegetable variety pack, gourmet meals, or my favorite, the seasonal! Good Price on Amazon too, especially if you do subscribe and save!!"
1,I'm so addicted to these!!! You know the movie When Harry Met Sally? When I drink one of these it just feels like that famous scene in the movie... orgasmic!
2,"I purchase a bag of the blueberry & apple tiny fruits today excited to discover and try a new product that fits my believes (healthy, organic, no additives, working with local communities, etc). I am so glad that I tried the fruits prior to inviting my 9 month old child to eat them. The blueberries that first came into my mouth where hard as rock and did NOT dissolve. A total choking hazard."
1,"Tart, bitter aftertaste, horrible diet rootbeer!  It makes me feel bad drinking this and I probably won't ever buy this brand name again."
3,This is really great Hot chocolate. The price is right too. Usually I find that hot chocolate k-cups are weak or watery but not this one. I was impressed. The dark chocolate is really yummy! I will be ordering more.
1,"This 8.3 ounce can of carbonated beverage is tangy and tasty. And the slimmer size can means that you are drinking a smaller serving than an ordinary can of soda. But although it's 100% juice, it still packs quite the calorie punch. One can is 140 calories, which is almost exactly the same as in a 12 oz. can of regular Coca-Cola! So it may be slightly healthier than drinking Coke since it has no caffeine or high-fructose corn syrup and it has 100% of your requirement of Vitamin C. But it's not going to make you as slim and attractive as the packaging!"
2,"I have a sweet tooth and so does my three year old son. This is a great after dinner dessert that I feel good about giving him and myself. They ARE healthy and you CAN taste the flax seed in them, but I have really grown to love that healthy taste and texture. I even come to crave it now. They are satisfying and filling and my whole family loves them. I buy them in bulk and love other Hodgson Mill products as well.<br /><br />  If you eat nothing but white flour products and can't get used to or absolutly hate whole grains and their taste and texture, then this is not the product for you. If you are the family that tries to make healthy choices and have healthier alternitives then this is a wonderful product. I still love to have my junk food (Pillsbury and Hershey's here I come!!!) I just try to have it only on very special occasions. The rest of the time I choose to nurish my body and satisfy my taste buds. That is when I reach for this brownie mix.<br /><br />  My only complaint is that they don't taste too great after only a couple days. So make up a batch, eat em' up quick (within 2 days) and you will be smiling!"
1,"This is a great alternative to regular soda in the sense that aside from being carbonated just like a regular soda, it contains vitamins and no added sugar making it really a healthy alternative. Its sparkling appearance also adds to the attraction to this juice. The only downside I can think of for this is it is expensive. Other than that its very satisfying."
0,"My husband and I enjoy a really good cup of tea. Lana's Snowflake Black Tea sounded so interesting and the five star reviews made it simply irresistible - I had to try it. The delivery was very fast and it was nicely packaged. When my husband saw we had new tea he had to open it. The next thing I heard, ""Wow, you have got to smell this"". The aroma is so wonderful, the sweet scent from the coconut and almond fills the air and the hints of vanilla are simply divine. While the fresh aroma is intense the smooth taste is beyond compare, a great substitute to after dinner desserts. Its calming essence makes it great for a quiet evening at home...be prepared to indulge your senses.<br /><br />Snowflake Tea now has to be our favorite tea. I plan to buy it as stocking stuffers for my friends and family. Lana, keep creating this tea, I plan to buy a lot more."
2,"I started out by purchasing the 4 oz trial package of Summer Brushtail and my little girl absolutely LOVED it!!  Now I am getting the larger package so we don't run out.  My Chinese Crested suffers allergies to poultry and grains and was pretty much limited to a red meat diet.  Since she is a hairless variety she was on a red meat formula coated in herring oil for her skin.  The herring left her with fish breath all the time.  This is a great alternative to the fish because the richness in omega 3 and 6 fatty acids and no more fish breath!!  Since she has been on this her skin quality is much better.  This is also great to mix with kibble if you have a picky little eater like I do, just mix a tbsp up in the kibble and you end up with a happy plate every time."
0,"We usually have fresh lemon grass tea at our local Zen center. It is extremely easy to make, put a few blades of lemon grass in a pot to steep and you will get a fantastic tasting tea.<br /><br />This tea is here is a fine replacement for when you cannot get fresh lemon grass. Lemon grass has many health benefits. It is said to detoxify the liver and can lower uric acid levels, this is important if you have gout.<br /><br />Because you get such a large quantity here on Amazon it should last you quite a while. Caffeine free and light it makes a very refreshing afternoon tea.<br /><br />Give it a try!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review."
0,"I have always enjoyed this particular tea, plain and simple.  A great green tea with a hint of ginseng and honey!  I buy it on Amazon because I can't find it in my area, so it's worth it!"
1,Celsius sparkling orange has a light carbonation and light orange taste which I love!<br />It is like an energy/metabolism booster drink combined with vitamins and minerals. I drink one every day.<br />Amazons subscription plan is the most cost effective way to buy!
2,"This is my son's favorite dinner! Best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein (21%) , vitamin A (100%) and C (30%). It is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it. Love love love this brand and flavor. I think I purchased 50 jars so far."
3,"Great product at a reasonable price....my husband's favorite! Loves the dark chocolate although we get the pack of 3 that includes light, dark and peppermint also.  Shopped around and this is a bargain and surpasses the other cocoa k-cups we have tried in taste."
1,"The biggest argument I have with Switch is that at a hair under $1 for each 8.3 oz can, it's awfully expensive.  I probably could overlook that if Switch was really, really delicious, but frankly it's not.  The orange-tangerine blend lacks the zip and character of those citrus fruits, particularly tangerine and its delicate sweetness.<br /><br />Instead, there's a heavy taste of the apple-grape combination of juices that forms the fruit base.  There's no added sugar, no high fructose corn syrup or any other sweeteners save the apple and grape concentrates, and that's fine, I'd prefer my juice to not have added sweeteners.  In my opinion, juice doesn't need to be sweetened.  I suspect that the fruit concentrate combo is cheaper than making the drink out of pure citrus juice, so I wonder why it's as expensive as it is.<br /><br />What makes me scratch my head is the notation ""Contains soy.""  What?  Why?  Why on earth put soy in a fruit juice cooler?  Honestly, I'd buy some seltzer or carbonated water of some sort and mix it with my own fruit juice before I'd buy Switch.  But if you'd rather have it pre-made, then by all means give it a try.  It's decent enough, just not my glass of juice."
2,"My daughter is not very picky, and would usually eat anything. I got her to eat about half a pouch the first time I introduced them to her, but it was a losing battle after that. They don't smell pleasant nor do they look appetizing. I really wanted to like these too, because they looked to be quite healthy."
0,"I decided to try this tea based on the description and reviews, but found it weak, with little flavor. For reference, I like my tea very strong and normally buy the Davidsonas English breakfast tea."
3,"Cobblestone Kitchen's Irish Creme Hot Cocoa mix has got to be the most luxurious tasting cocoa on the market.  We originally bought this cocoa to use as a base for Frappuccinnos but quickly decided it was way to good to waste in a mix.  The flavor is rich and smooth.  We have made it a part of our winding down for bed time procedure - a couple of cups together and just relax.<br /><br />Cobblestone Kitchen refers to the cocoas as ""Delicious and Decadent""  and they are being extremely modest."
0,I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere.  I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste.
1,"I was not overly impressed with this entry into the 'natural' soda sweepstakes. The flavor was OK, but it was achingly sweet. I enjoyed the small size, since it would be a better alternative to younger folks.<br /><br />But I would think twice because of the over-keening sweetnes."
4,"Our cats love this food!  Once they started, they almost refuse to eat any other brand.  All cats have stomach issues from time to time, but they are so much less with Earthborn Holistic.  Plus, they have softer, brighter coats and act more energetic.<br /><br />However, there is limited availability to Prime customers.  It's really hard to get this product.  Once they start becoming available to Prime members on a regular basis, my rating will be 5 stars.  I am begging Earthborn Holistic to make more product available to Prime members! :)"
0,"This is my new staple for morning tea selection.  All of them are good, clean tastes.  I like fairly bold tea, and these fit that bill.  The ""Lady Grey"" option was a nice surprise - just a hint of citrus, without sacrificing black tea taste."
2,"I believe the concept and the intended combination of ingredients is nutritious and may be delicious BUT not in this little package.  My 11 month old daughter took one bite and literally spit it out.  I tasted it and it was so lacking flavor.  I'll be making this combination for her on my own in our Beaba BabyCook.  The other fruit and veggie combinations are great, but this offering missed the mark completely."
1,"I am very fond of citrus drinks to begin with, so maybe I am biased.<br /><br />But what I liked most about this was it wasn't too sweet and it is all natural.  And it has a real citrus taste not a fabricated one.<br /><br />Love it."
2,Gave it to my daughter who uses it in recipes but I wanted to use it in smoothies.  It tasted to bad to me.
3,"These are so nice and creamy!  Usually I don't justify buying k-cups for things like cocoa that you can get cheaper in a packet, but this is so convenient and very good tasting .. way better than most powdered cocoa packets I've tried.  As far as price comparison, it is equivalent to gourmet-types of cocoa that would easily cost $1+ per packet.  I also like that it comes in a variety pack with 3 flavor options.  Highly recommend"
1,You will like this drink if you're into sweet tasting drinks. The bulk of the juice is apple and grape but it does have a strawberry taste with LIGHT carbonation and it is all-natural. It's an all-natural strawberry flavored Fanta!
4,"My cat seems to really like these.  As one reviewer said, they will dry out if the bag isn't sealed.  I haven't had any problems with sealing the bag that I purchased."
1,"I was hoping for actual juice. A kiwi and strawberry combination is one of those combinations that I usually love. In fact if you combine strawberry with anything I'm usually game (steak, chocolate, banana, etc.) and this COULD be a good drink. However, it's in the fizzy drink school of beverages and as a fizzy drink, I can't stand it.<br /><br />Granted, I was never too fond of the fizzy drinks in the first place. The orange drinks were always a bad second to actual orange juice. Not that I don't love pop, but I really can't get behind a bad orange juice pop.<br /><br />So at first taste, this is rather sweet. But then it goes down and its too sweet. And fizzy. The fizzy and the sweet combine and you are drinking candy. Not that pop is anything but candy, but there's candy and there's candy and this is the hard candy that your grandmother gives you to suck on to shut you up for a few hours.<br /><br />Not very good."
4,"This is another favorite in our house.  My cat doesn't want it more than 4 times a month or so, but he still wants it and licks the bowl clean.  It is fish, not his favorite, but he really likes his salmon and this one is outstanding.  It's ground (why don't they make a sliced or bits version?), not his favorite either, but he does get it down pretty quickly.  Try this one - it's a definite winner."
3,"I bought a box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa because I love their Cappuccino French Vanilla.  I used the medium cup setting and added some whipped cream...it was to die for.  Very yummy and almost as good as homemade.  I never noticed an aftertaste like other reviews, but it could be because of the Redi Whip I added to it.  I highly recommend it."
4,"This cat food isn't the highest quality, but it is definitely not the worst. It's far better than any of the Purina cat chows available, all of which are offered at a similar price per pound. For the price, this is the best cat food on the market, and you can't beat free shipping!"
0,"Rest assured, this tea has a natural tasting pear flavor.  Although this tea does included real pear pieces, they also use a pear flavoring to amplify the taste (apparently brewing pear pieces doesn't kick it up quite enough.) It's been my experience that some pear flavor is pretty awful (ala absolut pears,) this stuff is really good, and quite flavorful."
0,"This Passion tea is used at Starbucks. We mix it with two Lipton tea bags for iced tea. Really good, fruity flavor. Great for summer!"
0,"The tea bags work well with loose tea and buying the pack of six makes this a good value. But what you're not told is that the bags are the large size, better made for large pots and not single cups."
0,"Haven't been able to find loose Lipton's tea in grocery stores for years and was delighted to find it here at Amazon. This is absolutely the best buy in tea I have made in my life. Received a very ample supply quickly at minimum cost and Amazon paid the shipping.<br /><br />The Tea is as good as I remembered it and I am a happy camper again, able to make my own by the pitcher.<br /><br />Thank you, Amazon."
0,This tea is great. It has a beautiful smoky flavor that can't be beat.  People who don't normally go for green tea will want a second cup. I highly recommend this tea.
3,"This is the best hot cocoa I have tried for the Keurig.... Rich, chocolate flavor (I used the 6oz setting) and it is not watery.  If you like hot cocoa, and the convenience of a K-cup, this is the one to get!"
0,"Having tried a very large number of Earl Grey teas, I've been struck by how particularly flavorful this brand is.  It's really worth trying.  I ended up buying the pack of 6 boxes twice I liked it so much."
0,"One of my favorite restaurants serves this tea iced. They were kind enough to share the brand name with me when I asked. It makes wonderful, refreshing and healthful iced tea. Highly recommend."
1,"Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.<br /><br />On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan."
1,"This is mostly concentrated apple and grape juice reconstituted with carbonated water; it's extremely sweet and more caloric than soda.  Do people who consume this think they're drinking something healthy, or indulging in liquid candy?  Or is this supposed to be used as a mixer, e.g., for making daiquiris?"
2,"My dad introduced me to these things when I was kid. We used to eat them all the time on opening day of the trout season, or deer hunting up in the cascades. My brother always calls them ""heart attack in a bag"" even though he can't stop eating them. They really are that good!"
1,"At first, I really wanted to like this drink. ""The Switch"" tasted like tangerines and had a good aroma. The drink is carbonated, but not really strongly so. It is pleasant. However, after a few seconds, an after taste developed that was a little bitter. My wife thought this after taste was even a little ""off"", but she has a more sensitive palate than I do. In any case, the net effect was that I would just as soon have Orangina, and I won't be going out to buy more of ""The Switch"" Orange Tangerine. On the other hand, if this is what was being served at a party or gathering with few or no other choices, I wouldn't avoid it either."
0,I am very happy with this tea.  I hesitated to order because of price but it comes in a nice tin with 50 round tea bags.  It is great tasting.  I add ginger chips to it and it really is great when I have an upset stomach.  I just recently received my second order.
3,"Ordered on a whim.  My first ""Grove Square"" purchase.  Great for the family's occasional cocoa desire.  Being a K-Cup it's fast and easy.  Was a little worried the cocoa might leave some after taste in my coffee, so far so good.  Great cup of dark, rich cocoa.  Maybe could taste a LITTLE better if it was from a gourmet brand you mix yourself with steamed milk.  The ease and simplicity, and lack of clean up, make this a better option for me.  Will order again.  Nice to see it on subscribe and save."
4,The cats love it. I could live without the smell and seeing the pieces of cut up fish in it but the cats love it.Wish I would have purchased more the price was right and it is good quality food for them.
2,The salmon is my daughter's favorite Happy Baby flavor.  I like feeding it to her because it adds fish to her diet and I want to keep tuna to a minimum.
0,"If you like the flavors of a good British Tea,  this is a fairly good substitute.  The Earl Grey and Lady Grey are very good.  You have to put milk and sugar in them to make them really delicious!  I like the Irish Breakfast - very full bodied.  The English breakfast is good but not my favorite when it comes to the Breakfast teas.  I like Republic of Tea's British Breakfast the best.  This is a great sampler package."
2,"We purchased a pack with all the flavors and my daughter cannot devour them quick enough.  She has enjoyed all the flavors, but really seems to enjoy the apple/blueberry the most.  She can easily grab the fruit and, even though she doesn't have teeth, it goes down smoothly.  I feel better as I am feeding her organic fruit that is safe!  It's a win win situation!"
0,My favourite tea in loose leaf form... it just doesn't get any better than this.  The tins are a good size (not so small that it's gone after four cups of tea but not so large that it'll be stale and moldy before you could possibly finish it) that fit nicely in my desk at work as well as on the counter by the teapot.  The tea is fresh and flavourful with the quality I've come to expect from Twinings.
0,"It always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea.  I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it.  It's an excellent morning tea, is smooth without being insipid, and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping. Just use decent water.  I like a little stevia in it, as I'm a wimp. It brings out the natural sweetness of its malty, slightly floral style.  I just bought another two pounds."
2,we tried some other organic baby foods lately and she loved them but unfortunately she hates HATES HATES this food.  She's never had such a reaction to any food before but actually cried and screamed at the first taste of this.  I guess it's just not for her.  We've given her other foods from happy baby and she's loved them but this one she will not eat.  Too bad I bought a huge package!
4,"My cat will NOT eat this food. I don't know why, but it was a waste of money. I was looking for something cheap so I guess you get what you pay for."
2,"I bought this for my 8 month old grandson to try.  He loves it!  I'm so pleased that I am ordering it for my infant great-niece and also for part of an all organic baby shower gift.  This food is inexpensive, convenient, and organic.  Best of all . . . He likes it!  I'm setting up the recurring delivery method for my grandson.<br />CORRECTION!  The product I ordered two weeks ago was $7.76 a case.  Now the cost is $11.03.  That's quite a price hike.  Is there any way to be notified if the price goes back down?"
2,"I give props to any mom, especially one that holds down a full time job or two, that can puree and strain her own food.  If that's you, hat's off.  You're my hero.  I'm no superhero, so my goal was to find the best quality, best tasting food with minimal processing.  Let's face it, there are plenty of organic options out there.  And these days, I think most of them are good.  The little man likes the Gerber organics fruits.  They're easy to find and inexpensive.  But hands down, the Happy Baby products are the best quality, best tasting (in my opinion) and most convenient of them all.  The pouches are great, especially for when we're on the go.  We can eat the fruit varieties without even putting on a bib.  The Chick Chick is the man's favorite (bib required).  The negative is that they're about twice the price of the Gerber fruits and meats.  So if you're on a budget, this may be a bit of a stretch.  Nonetheless, keep some pouches around for when you travel.  Baby will love them!"
1,"My daughter thinks this tastes like Sunkist Orange Soda, my grandson likes it and drank the rest of it (most of the can).  I thought it was okay (by I am not a fan of orange sodas); I would undoubtedly like it better in another flavor, like Grape, or Fruit Punch, or Kiwi Berry.<br />I think this is, of course, a much healthier alternative to any regular soda. And judging from my dautgher's and my grandson's experience with it, it would be hit with most kids."
0,I've been ordering this tea directly from the company and really like the flavor. I was surprised to find it on Amazon and at a lower cost...good value for great tea.
0,Great coffee brewed very quickly.  Two brew settings allows for one cup as well as one mug.  Hot water for tea or other hot beverages.
0,Excelent quality one of the best tea. The pack of 6 of one kind should migrate a different flavors.
1,"It is so hard to find a nice juice drink that is either too sugary or, even worse, has additives like artificial sweeteners. The Switch Orange Tangerine delivers on flavor. If you like juice and want a full-flavored orangy-carbonated fizzy drink, this one fits the bill. Very good!"
1,"This is a nice, light, refreshing carbonated fruit juice. It's something like Orangina, but far more natural-tasting -- which makes sense, because unlike Orangina, it's all juice and has no added sweetener.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the 8.3 ounce can is rather small; I generally prefer a larger drink. It's definitely not a bargain if you have to drink two cans at a time."
4,"I have 4 cats and was spending an amazing amount of money shopping for them at Petsmarts and Petcos locally. I wish I would have discovered this food earlier. This 40lb bag lasts us nearly 2 months! If you order it new from Amazon you don't even have to worry about the shipping, it's free (and for something that weighs 40lbs that's a good thing!)<br /><br />The ingredients aren't that great but at least it's not Corn or grains as the first ingredient..so it's passable. I mix the dry food with higher quality canned food to give them that extra boost of protein and flavor since my cats tend to get bored of the same food over and over. I find if I mix it with different flavors of canned food they NEVER get tired of it (it can even be a small can, nothing fancy if you can't afford the high quality stuff).<br /><br />The kibble is large in size but I actually prefer it that way..when the cats come in from a long day outside they are ravenous and the large size of the kibble helps them slow down and actually break it apart..I have never seen them throw up a hairball from this food like they used to from other dry foods and that is saying A LOT! I got so used to wet messes on the floor and now there are none! Add in the the wet food from time and time (not daily) and the kibble becomes easier to eat for them. It keeps their teeth very clean in it's pure form though.<br /><br />All in all I have ordered this bag 3 times now this year since I discovered it and it's saved me a lot of money and a lot of time and my cats are not overweight or lacking in any way. No allergies, shiny coats and full of energy..I simply can't find a reason to complain."
2,"It is a mixture of chicken, sweet potato and pasta. But you can't really see the chicken, and I guess it has been pureed really fine. My daughter loves it and can finish the whole pack under 5 minutes. I like it becuase it has a good combination of protein, fiber and carbs. Plus it is organic! This is the second case I bought, and will continue buying. And the shipping was fast and packing is very good."
1,I happen to like foods that arent as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks. Very refreshing after mowing the lawn and helped  keep those afternoon headaches away.
0,"I am hooked on it.  It's just wonderful.  Highly recommended for taste and flavor and price.  I've tried different teas from different restaurants and tea houses, but I just love this one for home.  I use it nearly every day.  Will be trying more of these teas in the future."
0,"I love this tea!  I have tried at least 40 brands of Earl Grey including British Imports, boutique tea shops, special blends, and variations on the traditional bergamot/black tea blend.<br />The flavor is so well balanced with a real bergamot taste.  This is not the typical weak flavor in many off the shelf blends.  This is the real deal and can only be compared with the best that this traditional blend has to offer."
3,I thought the Grove hot chocolate is to sweet. It also has an off taste. I would not recommend this to anybody
3,"Definitely use the smallest amount of water and be sure to shake the cup before brewing.  The kids got a kick out of making their own ""kid coffee"" but this was only after we tweaked it with less water and brewed it with 3 marshmallows on top. (The hot cocoa hitting the marshmallows releases added sugar as well as turns the marshmallows nice and mushy :)<br /><br />The rest of us don't care to waste our daily calories on something that was, in our opinion, chocolatey water.  Still, it was worth the price for the simple fact that the kiddos can come in from sledding and brew their own hot cocoa without much mess."
2,"I will start off by saying I have yet to purchase this on amazon but I have purchased this at health food stores. So I can not say how it will arrive to you but i cant tell you about the taste.<br />  Amy's organic has consistently done a great job of creating delicious vegan/vegetarian organic food. This soup has a very similar taste to certain canned pasta product. It totally brought me back to my childhood. It is extremely delicious, low in fat and calories. It is a quick and healthy alternative to the old stand-bys we are used to. Whether to give your child a better lunch or a trip down memory lane for yourself please give this soup a chance."
1,"I enjoyed the product very much.  I like that it is not overly sweet or heavy.  There is no aftertaste and it goes down smoothly with just enough carbonation to give it body.<br /><br />The tangerine/orange taste I found to be clean.  If you like something that is sweeter, this might not be for you.  But if you enjoy the fruity taste with some carbonation it is quite nice.  I drank it chilled.  I don't think I would have enjoyed it at room temperature.<br /><br />The price might keep me away.  Almost a dollar per 8oz can is kind of tough.<br /><br />Four stars for taste and two stars for price = three stars."
2,"My baby is 7 months old and maybe wasn't as ready for these biscuits as I imagined. He's got 2 bottom teeth and is very able to get chunks off these biscuits! The pieces take a long time to dissolve/break down in his mouth, but he handles it better than I would expect and he can't wait to dive in for more. He has tasted a wide variety of foods and I've never seen him get so excited about any of them. He LOVES Belle's Blueberry teething biscuits - especially after they've been in the freezer for a bit. Even though I have to watch him closely, they're exactly the cure for little man's teething pains!"
0,I bought this for my son who travels often - he's told me the thermos worked well & the blooming teas were good for 6 brews!
0,"I drink a lot of flavored black teas and this is hands down one of my favorites. The scent is enticing and the flavor is bold, and sweet at the same time.  If you love spice, this is a must have tea."
1,I usually drink my soda room temperature but with this one I really needed it to be cold.  The taste is okay but takes a bit getting used to the tangerine in orange soda.  There was not as much carbonation which is fantastic as far as I'm concered and it wasn't exceedingly sweet.  I would most certainly consider getting this again as I don't think it's all that bad.  It's nice to have a bit of change from the usual orange soda flavor.
2,"We ordered the Earth's best 2nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack.  We got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack, not the dinner pack.  Found out we can't return the item, either.  We will try the Amazon phone help, but if all else fails maybe my little one will like this stuff..."
1,"This is what happens when you try to cross a juice with a soda and it somehow works.  Carbonated, slightly sweet, and 100% juice, this drink gives you the bubbly soda experience without the sticky sweetness that makes you feel slightly ill.  The berry flavor is not too strong and the carbonation is just the right amount.<br /><br />The only downside is the size of the can.  For some reason this comes in Red Bull-sized cans, which leave you wanting more.  A regular 12 oz soda can would have served this excellent drink better."
4,It is amazing to see the even split on reviews. I have a Ragdoll cat who was having the occasional hairball. He loves these treats and has only had one hairball since (shortly after starting these). I couldn't be happier with the product.<br /><br />I got them at Walmart. The current amazon seller seems to be a rip off.
0,"Yogi's Breathe Deep is an OK tea for those of us who have asthma and other respiratory ailments. It's a blend of eucalyptus, thyme, and peppermint. Eucalyptus has clearing qualities, but the thyme and peppermint... are kind of mild. Thyme is one of those laidback Gallic herbs (it's in Herbes de Provence blends) Yogi Tea's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMIYX6"">Yogi Cold Season, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> is MUCH stronger, since it blends eucalyptus with the heady herbs of cinnamon, clove, and cardamom. Breathe Deep is great... but Cold Season has amazing clearing qualities."
1,"This is a really nice drink -- more satisfying than pop. It's carbonated juice with no sugar or preservatives added. Here's how they can say it's 100 percent juice: ""filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates"" is added back in. I'd really like to try more flavors -- maybe a sparkling pineapple orange? Mmmm."
3,"Of course the Keurig Green Mtn Hot Cocoa is the ultimate in convenience, but, frankly, the flavor is not so hot.  Best description is slightly chocolate-flavored cardboard.  Everything else about it is fine (consistency, ease of use), but G.M. should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate."
4,"I've always wanted to go to a raw diet for my Cairn but in its frozen form it took up too much room in our RV fridge/freezer as we travel/camp a lot!  A friend recently told me about Addiction and this is the answer for us - takes up little space in our cupboard and provides a healthy diet, along with a mixture of Wysong Epigen kibble, and fresh fruits and vegetables that our Cairn loves; he's a very happy camper!  The cats at home love it, too!  We've only tried Brushtail but get the Venison treats for variety.  I'm sure we'll try the others, too, for a change up from time to time - (done in moderation and over a period of time so as not to upset the tummies!)!!!!"
2,"I really wish my toddler liked this. It seems to be very high quality and it would provide more variety in his diet. Every so often he'll eat it, but it usually needs to be mixed with something else.  I think it tastes fine, but it wasn't a hit. I bought a case so I keep trying."
4,"This food variety is ground, thus my cat doesn't care that much for this variety. But, he liked the taste of it a lot so I have been buying it off and on throughout the years.  My previous cat really liked it so I've purchased quite a few of these.  It's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares? If your cat likes ground, give this one a try for sure."
4,"YUM, I am SO HAPPY my mom bought this delicious and nutritious cat grass for me!  It helps me digest my food, and is just fun to poke around in when I'm bored.  And I notice that mom eats it too (when she thinks I'm not looking!) because it is so tasty!"
0,Great tea just like in Turkey.Easy to mix and prepare. My wife thinks it's a little sweet. I love it
0,I ordered this item because it was on sale and because of the health benefits of green tea.  I wasn't certain how good it was going to be but I was pleasantly surprised.  It tastes refreshing and fruity.  The flavor isn't overpowering or fake.  I mix the powder in a sports bottle along with cold water and splenda.  The powder dissolves easily and the drink has a nice green tea and blueberry taste.  I was so impressed that I have signed up for automatic delivery.  It's a great product.
4,"My cats just love the Seafood Medley Temptations.  They can't get enough of them.  We go through 10 large packs in about 2-3 weeks.  We have only 2 cats, a 3 year old male and a 17 year old female. They will eat only the Seafood flavor.  The male cat will eat only dry food and Temptation Seafood Medley and whatever he can catch outside.  The female loves can food with gravy, dry food and Temptations Seafood Medley. She doesn't hunt anymore but she will eat some of whatever the male catches.  I will definitely be ordering more. Thank you for such a good product and very good service. I recommend them to my friends with cats."
1,"This stuff tastes awesome! And for once in a kiwi/berry drink you can taste the kiwi, I'd be very hard pressed to tell the difference between this and a traditional soda.<br /><br />I also like the fact that it's in a tall and slender can, fits in the fridge better and you can't mistake it for that pesky regular soda... :)<br /><br />However I would not say that this would be a better alternative to soda based on the fact that it still has a solid 33g of sugar. Yes it is better for you because it is made with 100% real juice instead of corn syrup, which I definitely like, but it's no different then drinking the 100% frozen juice from concentrate.<br /><br />Overall I really like the product and will probably buy some to have as an alternative to soda (for those few times a year).<br /><br />Pros:<br />You can actually taste the kiwi and the berries.<br />100% REAL juice, no artificial flavoring.<br />Very carbonated, not the least bit flat.<br />Quenches your thirst and is refreshing.<br />NO CORN SYRUP!!!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Spendy.<br />Although it is all natural, still contains 33g of sugar...<br />135 calories a can (ouch!)."
1,"I certainly hope that Switch will be selling this product in larger packages - I was very disappointed when my Tangerine soda was gone - it was very good!  Actually tasted like tangerines, which was a surprise as most of the sodas on the market don't have much distinctive flavor at all.  Switch sodas are pleasantly carbonated, sweet without being overwhelming so, and very satisfying, particularly when drunk very cold!"
2,"We just got a new shipment in, and it is not the same Chick Chick our son has come to know and love.  This new stuff resembles the texture of their ""Gobble Gobble"" food, which our son absolutely hates.  I'm sure this stuff is great, but if you aren't sure your kid will like it, don't spend money on 16 of them up front.<br /><br />Be aware that you can't return this item."
0,"Although Revolution Tea's website says their Sweet Ginger Peach black tea is their most popular flavor, I feel like this and the Acai Berry Green are the best flavors in a really great line of tea.  As I've already reviewed on amazon, both of these flavors (as well as Revolution's Orange Chocolate Green tea) totally blow Lipton's Premium Tea Pyramids out of the water. The clear nylon tea bags that both brands use let you easily compare the quality difference -- whereas revolution uses long whole tea leaves, lipton uses little flakes and particles.  If you're willing to commit to 6 boxes of this tea you can buy it here on amazon for about half of what you'd pay on revolution tea's website!"
3,"This tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesn't taste very chocolatey. The name brand cocoa Kkups are better, or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better."
0,"The company has been around for over 160 years, is the company that started PG Tips and started and owned Red Rose tea so you know you're dealing with a quality tea company. The flavor is very similar to PG Tips to me; but stronger. It's definitely a milk and sugar or honey tea due to it's strength and you'll be happy that the milk doesn't 'water it down' in any way. With milk you'll still enjoy the full tea flavor; the milk only enhances the taste. It is a very strong tea, so be prepared for that. Otherwise it is a high quality, full flavored tea at an economical price. PG Tips is still my favorite but since I can't find it in my area but can find Brooke Bond Red Label at my local WalMart I'm a convert due to the quality and the very similar flavor to PG Tips...maybe it's just me, but I taste the similarity.  You won't regret trying this tea!"
0,"Warning - this tea is packaged in the US, and not the UK.  Hence, it is weak and tasteless compared to the British equivalent.  Very disappointing."
1,This product is a light and fruity carbonated beverage.  You might ask how that's different from any other soda.  The difference is that this one leans more on the fruit side rather than the soda or sugar side.  I liked that about it.  While it was sweet it wasn't syrupy sweet to the point that it was cloying and it did not have a strong after taste.  Also it had a much more juicy aspect to it.  Its kind of hard to describe but the best comparison I can make is it's like one of those fruity V8 juices only carbonated.  Maybe that's not right either but I'd recommend trying this at least once.  It just may be a taste you'll find you'll like again.
3,"I love this hot chocolate. In my opinion, it's the best on the market.  It has a nice grown-up flavor of chocolate and coffee."
0,"But, I have tried some other teas to find something to replace that awful Lipton junk that I have been using for my iced tea for years. What I do know is that it has great flavor in iced tea, better than anything else I have tried (although I haven't tried any of the other Davidson teas). Tastes like dirt? That reviewer needs a taste bud tune-up."
4,"Not only kept her clear, she put much needed weight on after diagnosed with a chronic illness she has beaten. I've read some of the other reviews. As a former Vet Technician I do ask, if your cat is vomiting please see your vet asap. Hairballs that are very bad can kill a cat."
0,"This is good tasting tea, no need for sugar....I am drinking one cup per day usually at mid- day for blood pressure...........I am not sure how long it takes to help lower BP but if it helps even a little it's worth drinking especially since its very tasty........"
3,We appreciate the short list of ingredients on the Ghiradelli hot chocolate mixes.  The Chocolate Mocha flavor is rich and chocolatey with out being overpowered by the coffee.  This is one of our favorite cold weather drinks.
1,I still like cherry the best but the blue zotz are good. The turn your tounge blue so watch out for that.
1,"This drink left me thirsty, which isn't good when said drink is supposed to quench your thirst.  It's bottle is appetizing, though I found the drink took very little time to finish.  When it comes to taste, it was lacking.  Either the mixture of the Kiwi and Berry was off or something because it reminded me far more of an energy drink than a juice drink.  To its benefit, there was no icky after taste.<br /><br />I will not be 'switch'ing anytime soon to this drink, but recommend giving it a try, as all our taste buds are different.  Maybe you'll like it.  It just wasn't my cup of tea."
1,"This is almost the kind of fruit soda I'd make if I were going into this business. The difference is that I'd go the Odwalla route and not use reconstituted juice concentrate and only use orange/tangerine juices. Since it's a carbonated beverage I'd probably use a stabilizer too so it wouldn't have to be shaken before drinking. That would result in a higher price, though not sure how much higher than the almost $1/can price it's being offered as a grocery item (imagine the price in a vending machine).<br /><br />For this product the first ingredient is apple juice and the second is grape juice, then comes the tangerine and orange juice and finally acerola juice (a fruit high in Vitamin C and apparently popular in Puerto Rico and Barbados).  There's acacia gum (as a stabilizer probably, don't want to have to shake a carbonated drink) and then additional natural colors and flavors, ascorbic acid and soy.<br /><br />My 13yo daughter and I shared a can and liked the taste.  On a par with Orangina. My personal preference would be for a little more carbonation, but this was ok. I'm a traditionalist so I definitely prefer a 12oz. can, the quantity at this price makes me feel a little ripped, but then, I prefer to make my own lemonade in the blender adding in some raspberries or strawberries or mint to vary the flavor.  Cheers!"
2,"My little boy is nearly two and has become an extremely picky eater.  The peas and carrots he used to love just get thrown on the floor and the little chunks of squash I give him - he spits them out and makes himself gag!  So, these pouches are my salvation!  I mix the powder with a little milk into macaroni and cheese and voila!  Now he eats macaroni and squash and cheese or macaroni and peas and cheese and we are both happy :)  The squash is also great mixed into spaghetti sauce.  It's just an added bonus that they can sit in the pantry without going bad for weeks or months so I always have some veggies on hand for him."
2,"My daughter loves these dinners. There's no other organic meat option at my grocery store, so we're stuck with this one, but I don't mind at all. I think they're great. I agree that they are runny, but you can just thicken it with whole grain cereal, and problem solved (turkey dinner is thick enough).  I also don't understand why people complain that they are too sweet, or unhealthy. First of all, if you don't like the ingredients, buy something else. Second, I trust Earth's Best enough to believe they know the right amount of stuff to put in their product. Third, the belief that if baby tastes sweet food, they will not eat regular food, is an old wife's tale. Are you people saying that you don't give your babies fruit and vegetables? They are all sweet.<br />The only reason I gave this particular item 4 stars instead of five, is the price. I can buy it at my grocery store for 79 cents a jar. Here, they are being sold for over 91 cents. And that's at the sale price. If you buy these at the regular price, it comes to $1.41. Way too much!"
2,"My whole family loves these. Not just for babies. These are wholesome organic snacks. If you love bananas, then these are an excellent snack.<br />Great for the whole family any age. I plan to have these as a staple snack in our home."
4,"I have two big cats that are over 15 lbs. each.  For breakfast, I give them each a packet of Whiskas Choice cuts.  They inhale the food in about 2-3 minutes.  This food doesn't have that catfood smell that most canned foods have.  There's a lot of gravy so the price is pretty high considering the amount of liquid.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K"">Friskies Cat Food Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> are more expensive and very similar.<br /><br />I have these on Subscribe and Save so the price is pretty good.  Based upon my cats reaction, they really like this food."
0,"This is a VERY good tasting tea and has helped me more than once with that ""heavy"" feeling of congestion.  It's one of many herbals that I keep in our home."
3,"I love hot chocolate and was very excited to find a variety pack, however, these are gross.  Horrible after taste, my kids dont even like them.  Now I have 3 boxes of the stuff that no one will drink.  Very disapointed."
0,"Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) at $17.14 is a STEAL.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Twinings tea, then perhaps you ought to start tasting REAL tea - the type the Royal Family awakens to, the type everyone who enjoys tea outside the U.S. enjoys at tea time.<br /><br />Twinings, around since the beginning of the 18th century, literally saved my life. While I shall not go into that story, I will tell you what you can expect: a decent, dazzling cup of tea that will, I guarantee, make you basically drop coffee forever.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the meal known as 'tea' since I was a boy. My parents avoided it for some reason but I always had my Twinings. Since it got too complex hereabouts, I just order tea bags these days instead of a good old-fashioned brew-up with my favorite antique English teapot.<br /><br />It appears that in this variety pack you are getting the following: English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Earl Grey and Lady Grey. For you ignorant slobs, Irish breakfast is the finest, blackest and strongest tea you can get. English is a bit dialed back but it is just as hearty. These beg for cream and sugar, but it is no sin to have it black. The Greys are meant to be taken with lemon and you'll suffer if you try to pour cream or milk into either of them!<br /><br />So there you are: a world of tea in one neat box, from my ONLY tea providers and lifelong at that. You can visit their site and buy direct; you can examine <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006RXQ2CY"">The Queen</a> closely and watch for the scene that reveals the Queen Mum's preferred tea.<br /><br />My second favorite, Irish breakfast tea being my first love, is the incomparable <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MOWL8M"">Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (20 Tea Bags)</a>, blended from premium Keemun and Ceylon (just you try to get good Keemun at a reasonable price).<br /><br />In the event it interests you, Twinings tea bags are designed like Lipton's clever invention, the 'double' tea bag (what they originally named ""FLOW-THROUGH"") that you can puff apart a bit if you like before steeping it. Twinings does not have any staples anywhere on their teabags, unlike other companies with a staple here and a staple there. You might as well buy staple-flavored tea.<br /><br />Get Twinings good cheer, the genuine cup that cheers."
4,"I haven't had a cat yet that liked this one.  It's just a little too interesting for them I think.  It smells nasty but I think it's just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just won't touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he's REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one."
1,Seriously a great orange drink on par with Orangina without being super crazy sweet.  I have purchased this frequently since my first taste of it through the Vine program. Also! Goes great with vodka or tequila!
0,"I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday!"
1,"Pros:<br />Tastes pretty good<br />Slightly lower sugar than soda<br />Vitamin C<br />Carbonation adds a little pizzazz<br /><br />Cons:<br />Leans toward being too sweet (at least for me)<br />Not significantly healthier<br />3/4 size can compared to regular 12 oz drink<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />It's an okay but not great blending of the soda and juice worlds. Personally I would say stick with the real thing for more satisfaction. IE, if you're in the mood for a juice beverage, grab juice. Soda same thing."
3,"These chocolates are absolutely the best, smooth in taste and almost delicate in texture. Their an absolute MUST for any chocolate fan, I've never been a fan of milk chocolate, but these Fazer chocolates are the absolute exception! I highly recommend these chocolates to anyone who loves chocolate as much as i do!"
0,Bengal spice is just perfect either for Ice tea or for hot tea! Also it make the Chai latte special! Thanks!
2,"my kids prefer the banana to the blueberry variety which is fine by me since these are usually a dollar or 2 cheaper. Perfect for snacks, car trips, and just about anything else you can think of. Extremely convenient lid keeps them fresh. Cannot say enough good things about these!"
1,"Great deal! Love this product. Trying to get away from diet soda and nutrasweet.  This is a healthy, refreshing option!"
1,"Each of these Switch juice drinks seems to be about 50 percent sweeter than it needs to be. Imagine mixing Perrier, Kool-Aid and Mountain Dew together and you've got a good idea what to expect. OK, I know it's not that bad. But would somebody please tell my taste buds?"
1,"I don't understand why the flavors included in this variety pack are not listed in the Product Features section, just below the photo.  One has to read down PAST the legal disclaimers to find what flavors are included.  And even once one gets to the Product Features section which reveals the included flavors, one must first get past the hype:<br /><br />Product Description<br />Every refreshing variety lets you add flavor to you water without adding calories. These are great for bottle water. Comes with 4 flavors; Wild Strawberry, Raspberry Lemonade, Natural Lemonade, and Cherry Pomegranate<br /><br />Despite the concerns that Aspartame is not harmless, I do drink a lot of Crystal Light.  Sugar is not harmless either, for some of us.  I can't afford the sugar and calories in real fruit juices as a beverage choice more than once a day.<br /><br />Crystal Light ""Natural"" Leomonade flavor is delicious.  What I don't understand is why all of the other flavors have a bad aftertaste.  I suppose it must have something to do with the  tartness of the lemon-like flavor that disguises it.<br /><br />""Natural"" Lemonade: aside from the ridiculous use of one of big fake food's favorite BS terms, ""natural"" (good grief, just look at the ingredients list!), this, for my taste, is the best Crystal Light flavor.  Though it's not what most people would consider natural, it does ""taste"" remarkably like real lemonade. However, I do use nearly twice the amount of powder and loads of crushed ice to get that taste.<br /><br />Raspberry Lemonade: Artificial tasting, slight bad aftertaste, you can improve this by adding half a real squeezed lemon. This used to taste better, but about a year ago it changed.  It still has less of the aftertaste than most of the other flavors.<br /><br />Wild Strawberry: Too fake tasting and terrible, strong, bitter, fake sugar aftertaste.  Almost as bad  as saccharine.<br /><br />Cherry Pomegranate: ditto<br /><br />My final complaint is the cost. I think there's a good deal of corporate greed involved here. I imagine the profit margin is astronomical. (Yeah, I know, I don't ""have"" to buy it.  They don't ""have"" to be greedy ba$t@rd$ either.)"
3,"My kids like this cocoa, but I find flavor less delicious than the more expensive <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VQXYMQ"">Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>."
0,"This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected."
2,both the kids and adults loved eating this treat. product tasted great and melted in the mouth. would definitely buy again.
1,"No caffeine, no high fructose corn syrup, 100% juice, nothing artificial. What's not to like?<br /><br />I hate to write anything negative because I don't want to discourage development of any products that avoid HFCS. But, to be honest, The Switch Orange Tangerine doesn't smell very good. If you're familiar with Airborne Cold Remedy, well, it smells like that. I think I was expecting a fragrance like Tang instant beverage. I certainly didn't expect it to smell like it does. It's not all that bad, it's just not real good.<br /><br />I also think this product would actually taste better if it weren't carbonated.<br /><br />The calories are about the same as a typical soda. But they're fruit juice calories instead of HFCS, so that's a big plus in my book."
1,"The product may be every bit as healthy as they claim, but even if that's true, I could barley get down one can of this stuff.  It tastes like sour orange juice with some carbonation in it.  It doesn't taste anything like orange soda, and the taste it does have isn't very pleasant.  Also leaves a very nasty aftertaste, and like many sodas, this will leave you more thirsty than when you started drinking.  All in all, I cannot recommend this.  Stay away."
3,"I'm pregnant and had to,give up my hot cup of coffee. I thought maybe a hot cup of this will suffice? Sure does! Throw the kcup,in- and this is the best hot choc ever! I choke down my vitamins with it too! Worth it and so cheap here!"
4,"My vet gave me this tip. I have had two cats with digestion problems, problems that they liked to make mine! My vet suggested 1/2 jar for a 10 lb or larger cat, 1/4 jar for a less<br />than 10 lb cat...per day or every other day. For some reason this settles their stomachs.<br />And they stopped purging on my carpet or my down comforter! They think it is a kitty treat.<br />I think it is a miracle."
0,I am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by Caribou Coffee.  I think I could be considered an addict! The flavor is so good - lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it.  Price for 50 is good and less than I have been able to find it elsewhere.
2,This 2nd foods is delicious and nutrient. My Babe swallows it quickly and wants the next one at once. I think it is because all of my family like the taste of cheese.
3,"The hot chocolate K-Cups don't work like the coffe K-Cups.  The coffee K-Cups have a screen inside the cup to keep the coffee grounds in the K-Cup, it also makes the last drop of liquid to fall into your cup as much coffee as the first drip.  These Cafe Escape Hot Cocoa K-Cups don't have a screen the chocolate powder empties out of the K-Cup as fast as it can, so that the last amount of water to come out of the Keurig is mostly water and it sits on the top of your cup.  So STIR it before drinking it, otherwise all you taste is the sweetener.  Also these K-Cups are made for 8 oz serving size, so use the appropriate cup size for your taste."
1,"Note:  I tried the watermelon-kiwi flavor first, and this review provides comparison to that flavor as well as unique information.<br /><br />Design/packaging:  I really like the can size.  It's narrower than a soda can, but the same height as a soda can.  It fits very nicely in my hand, and I could easily toss one of these in my purse or daypack.<br /><br />Nutrition:  The calorie and sugar count seems high on this drink, but if you compare it to the nutrition of the same amount of pure, unsweetened grape juice, it's the same calorie and sugar count, plus or minus 10%.  (It's worth noting that grape juice is the first listed ingredient, so this makes sense.)  Thus, they're probably not adding sugar or calories to the juice to make the drink.  The thing is, you probably shouldn't down ten of these a day, but one can as a snack or pick-me-up seems reasonable.<br /><br />Flavor:  Here's where Switch fell short in the Watermelon-Kiwi flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this flavor was refreshing and delicious.  It was not overly sweet like Watermelon-Kiwi.  I'm also very impressed with the flavor.  It's like a less-sweet orange soda, except that it's with real juice instead of artificial sweeteners.  I think this would be a great mixer as well as a nice snack beverage."
2,"This is excellent for a baby's first taste. The pouch size is perfect and it actually lasted me two days, as my baby is still just learning to eat solids, therefore didn't have it all. The top makes it easy to refasten, so it doesn't go to waste and can be used again. I love the pouch, it's easy to get all the product out wihtout making a mess."
1,"This is definitely a ""Girl's Alcoholic Slushy.""  There are 6 different flavors, and you can use any wine you choose. The package directions are for an entire blender of slush. I have found that using a Tablespoon or two at a time makes just enough for one person.  Good stuff.  Have not found anyone who does not like this product."
1,"This soda just did not appeal to me it had a very different taste than soda, (that is probably because I have never a Kiwi Berry Soda before), and it was really over sugared.  The carbanation level of the drink is low.  I think I was expecting this soda to be somewhere inline with Jones Soda.  This would certainly not be an item I would want to purchase again."
1,"My wife bought these and was trying to find an alternative sweetener in a soda.  We are not going to buy them again... sorry.  Other's may like the soda, not us."
1,"The drink is 100% juice concentrate reconstituted with carbonated water.  It tastes like a cross between <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GN4OHK"">Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans</a> and the orange drink from McDonalds.<br /><br />It was refreshing at first, but the aftertaste is abrupt and almost chemically.  It's odd, because the drink doesn't have any unnatural flavors, according to the ingredients list.  If the end flavor was more natural, I would definitely buy it again."
3,"I also tried the Cherry Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cup flavors and they are amazing!  So thick and creamy, especially if you make it with a little milk!  What I really like is that they aren't overly sweet, and that it mixed together very well, unlike most brands that just clump up and stick to the spoon.  Definitely my favorite hot chocolate!  The cider flavors are great too!"
0,"The first time I tasted this tea was about a year ago, and since then it has become my favorite. Never bitter, very consistent."
2,"My 15 months baby girl has allergy to cow's milk proteins.<br /><br />I can guarantee that this food is one of the few brands that do not contain potential allergens. And also, contain a higher nutritional value to other foods sold in the market.<br />My baby prefers warm. For this I put a few minutes in hot water.<br /><br />Amaranth Ratatuille y Chick chick are her favorites!"
4,"I liked that these treats didn't have anything gross in them (i.e., corn, wheat, soy, by-products).  My cats don't really care for salmon, but i thought since it was mixed with turkey, which they love, they might like them. Well they didn't, they took one sniff and wanted nothing to do with them.  Though my inside cats didn't want them, the stray cats outside loved them."
0,"I am an avid tea drinker and have tried so many teas, both loose teas and bagged teas, looking for the perfect cup of Earl Grey.  Rishi hit the ball out of the park with this one.  The flavor is strong and full, but still sweet and comforting.  It is not as bitter or as harsh as many other Earl Greys.  It has a fresh taste and smell.  The tea is superbly balanced and tastes as if there is more to it than tea leaves and water.<br /><br />To compare to some other teas, to give you a better picture of what I mean, it is a fuller flavor than Bigelow, Twinnings, or Ahmad, while being not as delicate as Numi.  It does not have the synthetic taste and smell of Stash.  It is not quite as pungent and bitter as Tazo (which I do like).  Mostly, it compares to Teavana's Earl Grey Creme, which I also highly recommend, but is a more robust flavor, with less of the creamy mouth-feel.  I highly recommend this tea."
3,"My husband and I are not coffee drinkers, but we love hot chocolate. We hated the time it took to heat up the water,and the mess the dry mix sometimes makes. We saw that the Keurig coffee maker did other things like hot chocolate and tea, liked that it was almost instant hot water, and bought one. I ordered another brand of hot chocolate k-cup, and absolutely hated it. It had a weird almost metallic taste that was not sweet or chocolately. I was worried I wasted my money on a maker I would never use. I decided to try another brand and purchased the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa, and we absolutely love it! It is sweet and chocolately without being too bitter(which is why I originally steered away from the dark chocolate). I fully recommend this product!!"
1,"I tried this after reviewing another Switch product (the black cherry flavor). The Kiwi Berry is also tasty, though for the life of me I couldn't taste the kiwi -- just strawberry.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry has the same problem as the Black Cherry, however; just SO much sugar! Ounce for ounce, it's as much sugar as in a regular, non-diet soda. I'd definitely drink any of the Switch products again ... but I won't try to convince myself it's a health drink!"
2,"My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.  Not all the time, but often.  The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.  He won't eat much when he's in pain, but these are easy on his gums.  They are organic and a quick meal.  My son is strong and a very healthy weight.  I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible.  Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.  He loves the whole line."
3,I am a big hot cocoa drinker so this hot cocoa I would definitely recommend it has a great cocoa flavor and it's perfect for those cold fall or winter days. Warms you up plus tastes great!
1,"SWITCH isn't a bad product, but it's not great either.  I like the fact that it's all natural sparkling juice.  The can design is pleasant to look at.<br /><br />However, the Kiwi Berry flavor is a bit syrupy for my taste.  Also, at 135 calories per can, this beverage has almost 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda.  Too many for me."
1,"Summary:  way too sweet, no berry/kiwi flavor, small serving.<br /><br />Upon first taste, both of us found this juice to be excessively concentrated sweetness.  Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very think and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.<br /><br />Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.<br /><br />Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).<br /><br />By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say ""no *added* sugar"", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying ""no sugar"" or ""no sucrose"" (table sugar).<br /><br />disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one."
1,"This superb tasting drink was used at the turn of the century for medicinal purposes as it purportedly had calming , but hallucinogenic effects. Thought to have same effects as THC but was disproved in 1999. But still , it is a very popular drink if mixed properly . Which is dissolving sugar through an absinthe spoon and mixing with vodka . Aptly named TNT. The drink was somewhat popularized by the character Inspector Frederick Abberline, played by Johnny Depp in the movie FROM HELL based upon Jack The Ripper."
1,"I buy syrups to make soda with plain seltzer water, and this one is by far the absolute most delicious one I have found. This particular flavor is incredibly true to a real red grapefruit flavor, yet sweet and powerful. What's great is that the flavor works whether I want just a little or a lot, depending on how sweet I want my soda to be on any given day. It's comparable to Squirt / Fresca, but honestly I think the actual flavor is much richer and more satisfying. If you like the taste of grapefruit even a little bit, you won't be disappointed."
1,I was really surprised at the taste of the Switch Orange Tangerine drink. It reminds me of carbonated orange juice. It is a little on the sweet side but not too bad in my opinion. This is actually a beverage that I could drink all the time and not get tired of.<br /><br />The BEST thing about Switch is that it is HEALTHY for you and it doesn't have any added sugars and it has a lot of Vitamin C. Switch is a all natural beverage which is great. You can have the carbonation of a soda without all the unhealthy unnatural ingredients of a soda.<br /><br />If you want a great tasting drink that is healthy for you then I highly recommend Switch. If you like orange juice then I think you'll really enjoy this. The cans are a little on the smaller side though.
4,My cats love this cat food. I am very pleased with all the varities. It is very healthy much more than the artificially colored store brands that made one of my cats throw up when he ate it. Their coats have become very shiney. Very impressice cat food. Highly recommend
0,"I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise.  The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat.  I think a better blend would be something with more ""heat"" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.<br /><br />With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that."
1,"Switch is a tangy drink that's more reminiscent of Sprite than Orange Juice. It's carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would've after consuming any soft drink. The drink doesn't feel sugary, but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains 34 grams of sugar. The claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added, so I'm assuming that's the sugar from the orange and tangerine. The can"
4,"Kitty loves these a lot and demands them morning and night. She doesn't really like to eat anything else anymore, although I make her. I am sure they are very bad for her, and wonder what special poison Purina puts in them to make them irresistible. These are constantly out of stock, and I can't buy them in any store in town. They are crack for kitties."
1,"Most of the carbonated juice drinks I've tried have either been far too sweet, far too carbonated, or just plain nasty.  So I tried The Switch with more than a little trepidation.  But this is not like any other carbonated juice I've ever had - it's actually good.<br /><br />First thing that hits you when you open the can is the scent -- it actually smells like fruit!  I know that may seem like a ""DUH!"" moment, but trust me, I've had some that didn't smell anything like the fruit they allegedly had in them.  The Switch is lightly carbonated; one thing I really hate is when the carbonation overpowers the drink, but The Switch doesn't do that at all.<br /><br />Since there's no added sugar in this drink, the sweet comes from the fruit.  That means it's not sickeningly sweet when you drink it, but it's also not bitter.  There did seem to be more strawberry than kiwi in the drink, but it was very good; a welcome change from typical juice or soda."
2,"My son is a little foodie and at 10 months has REFUSED to eat anything other then home made food. Lately I had started to become overwhelemed because I was coolong 3 different meals and I was worried that I wasn't making my son balanced meals. Insert Happybaby Super Salmon. Oh my god, he LOVES it! He eats the entire package. Some reviewers complained about the smell and yeah it smells kind of gross but it is FISH and fish isnt known for having the best odor. I would definetly recommend."
1,"Acid is, oddly, the most benign of flavor amplifiers.  Think about it.  Sugar? Salt? Alcohol? Fat?  I do not mean in any way to be a food fear monger. I merely point out that first glance, acid seems more menacing than any of those.  For kitchen magic, acid rules mine.  A splash of lime, coffee in my red-eye gravy, all those wonderful vinegars are lining my shelf.<br /><br />Now the resurgence of an ancient and feisty acid, verjuice.  It has largely been neglected outside of wine country.  Most of mine comes from odd places in Bordeaux.  But you can get this fine find from Fallot, a most reliable maker from Burgundy.  You may know their fine mustards.  This is one verjuice which you may confidently measure others against.  Why?<br /><br />Verjuice had not had modern marketing to spread its unique quality and flavor.  Sour grapes, you say? Exactly.  What do you do when the weather is so crumby that the grapes are not sweet enough for wine?  A good excuse to press verjuice.<br /><br />Now for the bad news.  Verjuice is in resurgence.  As with all things rediscovered, many are busy ""helping"" its image with a facelift.  Culinary botox.  From California to Australia, everybody is getting into the act; thin or flabby faux verjuice is hitting the shelves.  All cute and flouncy, it has not the backbone and courage to do the heavy lifting in the kitchen.  You might as well pour lemonade over your grilled salmon.<br /><br />But here is the acidic glory.  Taste it alone.  Now you can compare anything you might run across.  Some vineyards make the veritable verjuice.  Next, try poaching gently some fresh and really ripe fruit.  It loves to be swirled into your beurre blanc.  Whip some into your best cream.  Deglaze the roasting pan for some old time gravy.  Nutmeg and a nice five pepper blend (don't forget the allspice) are all you need for your steamed vegetables.  ""What did you do?""  And you can tell the truth."
0,"This tea is tasty with a slight smoky taste and the tang of green tea that I like so much.  However, there's not very much tea for this much can.  It is far from green regarding resource use and distant shipping of a lot of metal.  I've switched to one that comes in a pound bag.  Will see how I like it."
1,"This was pretty yummy.  I don't like pop (or soda for you Easterners) but I do occasionally crave a carbonated beverage that isn't too sugary.  This fits the bill.  It's light and refreshing.  (I know, ""light and refreshing"" are overused words when it comes to describing drinks, but it's true, I swear!"
4,"This food is so full of chunks that my cats just love.  They are normally on a variety of top quality pate foods, but I wanted to give them something to chew on and would take them longer than a few minutes to eat.  This is stuff kitty dreams must be made of for sure.  It is for both of mine anyway."
1,"Don't get me wrong, it is good. It is sweet and tart. It is slightly fizzy but not overly so. It is just big enough to quench your thirst before it gets warm.<br /><br />But WOW, it was sweet. I mean, this is Kool-aid meets Grenadine syrup with some lemon-lime soda tossed in. So if you are looking for something like soda water with a slight flavor, just keep going. If you want a sweet drink to get rid of a craving, then this is for you!"
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry carbonated fruit beverage is certainly different than what one expects to get out of a carbonated drink. Because it is 100% fruit juice, as opposed to fruit flavored, it is much more refreshing than the typical fruit flavored sparkling beverage. At 135 calories and 34 grams of carbohydrates - 33 grams of sugar - it might be a little heavy for the health or weight conscious. The only other drawback might be that the carbonation flattens out the depth of the flavor just a little. Nonetheless, Switch is a tasty and refreshing carbonated fruit beverage."
1,"I don't drink soda anymore and trying to be more health conscious. It has a great crisp taste like 7up, but the flavor or fruit. It almost reminds me of the carbonated fruity waters, but with more flavor. If you've ever had Jones Soda, that is the best way to describe it, but not as sweet."
0,"I love this tea.  It is very rich in taste, smells wonderful, and doesn't leave a funny after taste.  It's my favorite herb tea."
3,"Of all the cups I've used, this has the most rich flavorful on the large setting (for my 2 size machine).  Absolutely no chocolate left in cup - came  out clean looking - and no mess left in the machine.  My machine directions recommended doing a hot water cycle through after brewing chocolate but no need with this one. YUMMMM."
3,"After being disgusted by the brown water created by the Cafe Escapes dark chocolate cocoa, we were THRILLED to find these dark chocolate cocoa k-cups.  Delicious!"
0,I ordered Twinings Green Gunpowder With Mint. Without notice I recieved regular not with Mint which is nothing like I ordered.
0,Have used this herbal tea for sometime now...one cup before bedtime and it always helps me rest better.  Love the discount for ordering the six months supply.
1,This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you're set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.
1,"How can tang be lugubrious?  If you made it a bit watered down, a bit more aftertasty, a bit less child-friendly.  It's an all right soda, but I don't feel the thrill of drinking it that I did drinking tang as a child.  I can't pretend I'm an astronaut with this.  Sometimes, advertising just helps."
4,"My little beasts love this stuff. I have tried this, turkey, and salmon. All get 2 paws up. LOVE the packaging, and if smell is any indication, this must be good and healthy for my cats. Some cat food really smells like.. cat food.  This doesn't. The little girl kitty loves the smaller morsels, so she is eating more. I had been using Iams and although it's great also, she had a hard time chewing the bigger pieces.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this brand.  It may be a bit more expensive, but I notice I am not filling the litter bowl as much. My little girl kitty is putting on some much needed weight, but I am not buying cat food as often with this brand."
1,"I was skeptical when I tried this, but boy what a delight.  The flavor is deep but not too heavy, and the carbonation is just right; it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the juice.  It actually has a good ""mouth-feel"" - I drank it 15 minutes ago, and I can still feel a little hint of it.  It's like I had a thin slice of fresh kiwi and strawberry melting in my mouth."
0,I love this product the coffee and teas a great but they need to work on a hot chocolate it taste to water down
0,"I enjoy black tea blends over any other. I don't drink coffee, so black teas takes the place of it. Many variety packs have a selection of herbals, blacks and green teas. Thankfully Twinings offers us this variety pack of wonderful black teas.<br /><br />The Teas:<br /><br />Irish Breakfast:<br />I love this blend. I have always been a fan of Irish Breakfast. If your new to the tea, don't let the name and green packaging give you the impression there's anything minty about it. It's a straight black tea (typically 100% Assam teas). No sweetness or flavoring of any kind. This is typically taken with sweetener or has milk added to it to taste (like straight black coffee). I personally enjoy it without anything added, and drink it black. Because of it's caffeine content, I prefer drinking Irish Breakfast in the mornings. It also goes great with meals since there are no strong flavors/aromas to overpower the taste of ones food.<br /><br />English Breakfast:<br />Much like the Irish Breakfast tea, it is also a blend of black teas without flavors added. However, there are usually several black teas blended together (most common Assam, Ceylon and Kenyan) to produce the flavor of English Breakfast. The information of the exact leaves blended is not offered as information from Twinings, saying only that it is a blend of black teas, but those are the usually ones. While not as bold as the Irish Breakfast, it is still a strong tea that is typically accompanied by milk or sugar.<br /><br />Lady Grey:<br />A milder version of Earl grey, very subtle citrus flavors have been added to this blend. By no means is this a fruity tea, as it is just a tiny hint of flavor. Not nearly as aromatic as the Earl Grey blend, this Lady Grey has a much more delicate taste.<br /><br />Earl Grey:<br />Bold, aromatic and memorable. Most tea drinkers can pick out a cup of Earl Grey no matter the brand, and Twinings blend is no different. An unmistakable presence of Bergamot can be found, but is not so strong to be off-putting. Fans of Earl Grey will find this a medium strength blend, just enough to know what your drinking, but not the strongest on the market. A nice tea for afternoons and evenings."
4,"Our older cat is having some health issues, which I ""suspect"" could have been caused by pet foods many of us buy in local stores. We've been on a mission to find a healthy pet food we could trust after all the pet food recalls. After going through way too many products trying to find one that did all it claimed to do, we found the PetGuard line of food. This one really does appear to be all it claims to be and our cats are thriving on it! Our older cat loves it and is acting more like a kitten than he's acted in years. Both of our cats fur is silky and smooth and they seem to have endless energy, not to mention they love this stuff! Our youngest cat has digestion problems and most cat foods give him horrible gas.. But not this cat food! He isn't having any digestion problems at all..<br />Both our cats love the ""fish,chicken & liver"" dinner but our older cat isn't crazy about the ""seafood savory dinner"". He'll eat it but much prefers the fish,chicken and liver.<br />From my point of view, the fish, chicken and liver dinner doesn't smell too bad, but the seafood savor dinner smells really bad!<br />One problem I have with the food I've purchased from Amazon is that every single can in the case has been dented. I've purchased 2 cases and it's been the same with both cases.. I've purchased this from other vendors and never received a dented can, so this seems to be an Amazon problem.. Not sure why, but some of the cans are really hard to open!<br />I'm relieved to finally find a food I'm not afraid to feed my pets.. I've read articles about this food that state the meat used in it is a grade that can be consumed by humans. That makes me feel much better about what my cats are eating.<br />UPDATE:<br />It's been about a year since we started using this and our older cat is doing very well on it. Amazon was out of stock once when I needed to reorder, so I purchased another organic brand. Not only did our older cat turn up his nose to the other brand, but so did our 2 other cats. They would not eat the other kind, so when Pet Guard was back in stock, I ordered another case and the cats were happy kitties! They all love this stuff.. I think it stinks, but apparently, that's part of the attraction for them."
3,"I enjoy this cocoa very much, the children love it and drink it often.  I would purchase this product again."
1,"I tried one 8.3 oz of Switch in Kiwi Berry flavor. The can is very small, about the size of a Red Bull. The drink is said to be 100% juice carbonated, with no sugar added, no preservatives, no corn syrup, no artificial colors and gluten free.<br /><br />Each can has 135 calories, 15mg of sodium, 34g of carbs and 33g of sugar. On Amazon, the price comes out to about $1 per can.<br /><br />I like the fact that Switch is all natural, but the sugar content is still quite high (I believe a 12oz can of coke has 40g of sugar). Calories are not to be ignored either. The taste was OK, but not fantastic by any means - very sugary, not enough carbonation. In fact, the Kiwi Berry flavor did remind me of Red Bull as well, which I do not particularly enjoy. I think I'll stick to unsweetened iced tea..."
2,"I had high expectations based on some reviews, but aside from the apple, these were mostly blech and my baby did not like them.  The consistency of the squashes was very pasty, and the peas tasted like powder.  I ended up just using them to sneak extra nutrition in other dishes (the squash wasn't bad mixed with mashed potatoes, but I couldn't put in too much or the little guy was on to me!).  The apple was actually a really nice consistency, a little bit of texture and tasted quite delicious.  I definitely recommend getting the variety pack before launching into a big box of one kind.  It's a great idea, but won't work for everyone."
1,"I love Crystal Light. It has helped me to shed 45 pounds over an 11 month period, as the taste is so good I stopped drinking Sodas and sweet drinks as I had done for so long. And the price was very affordable to boot."
0,"Christmas Eve tea (which does not actually contain tea) is not just for Christmas Eve. (Although if you are frazzled, it does releave the stress.) Christmas Eve is good any time. I do not know anyone who doesn't like it, and have often given it as gifts. It is especially nice in the winter when mint teas are a little too brisk and do not produce the same level of cozy comfort as Christmas Eve which is a soothing combination of spices and mint. It is almost as comforting as a cup of warm milk, but without the calories."
0,"I love to make sun tea with these tea bags, it is very nice on a hot day to sit with a chilled glass. It is tasty and not too sweet, highly recommended!"
4,I bought this product because my older cat stopped eating the wellness dry and wet food I usually fed her.  She likes this food and she begs for it every morning and evening when it is time for her meal.  The ingredients are not quality ingredients but this food is keeping my kitty satisfied.
1,"I used to drink a lot of soda pop until I started having problems with calories. Then I switched to diet sodas. After drinking such beverages for years, I was finally convinced that diet sodas weren't doing me any good. Whether they were harmful is open to debate. In any case, I'll still drink a diet soda if nothing else is available and I don't worry any about it. However, I discovered the Crystal Geyser flavored spring water and enjoyed it very much. I first tried the lemon and lime and the latter was my favorite. More recently, I picked up a case of the Orange. It's good! It has a nice zesty carbonation and a nice very light orange taste. I like it ice cold. It goes real well with meals and the 18-ounce bottle is just the right size.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
1,I tried the Black Cherry version and liked it but this one is much better.  Great orange taste plus the benefit of juice.  And no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use.  The carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well.
3,"This is my absolute FAVORITE hot chocolate! Stephen's Gourment Hot Cocoa is all over Utah, but I have been unable to find it anywhere else.  I love it so much that I even pay shipping and handling so that I can enjoy it all the way on the east coast, too.  It's SO good! I look forward to it every year."
4,"I rescued a VERY VERY sick kitten (nearly died) and after he was well, he was still not interested in eating - until I found this.  This is not only very high quality & full of important nutrients, protein, fat, etc., but he LOVES it.  Since starting on his babycat, he is gaining weight & feeling MUCH better !  *WHEW !*  Note also that the 'kitten' formula of this is mostly the same but is little chunks - I mashed them, but its not the same as the pureed babycat !"
0,"If you want to try something different, this is a very exotic and refreshing tea with with many benefits for the body! The box arrived intact."
1,"I gave this a try because I love carbonated juice-stuff like bottled cranberry, apple, grape from Welch's and the like.<br /><br />Personally I liked this pretty well, though not as much as some other brands.  To me, it tastes and smells like tangerine, and I felt like I could kind of taste some of the component flavors making it up-the flavor is more complex than you'd get from a fruit flavored soda.  The carbonation is pretty light<br /><br />I definitely wouldn't mind trying some of `The Switch's other flavors...BUT, I split some of the tangerine flavor with a relative, and she thought it smelled like Jell-O, and didn't care for it-she said she'd rather have regular juice.<br /><br />I definitely liked this better than orange soda though!"
1,"Switch promises ""A perfect balance between juice and carbonation"" and it does live up to that as it delivers a fresh burst of stawberry and kiwi (the kiwi could have been a little stronger) and less carbonation then your regular sodas.  And it is a bonus that it is 100% Juice with no sugar added and no preservatives<br /><br />My main drawback is the can as the tall thin can is a little too small and regular soda cans that are shorter and thicker and stream out better than the taller, thinner ones like Switch."
0,My family makes a lot of ice tea during the summer.  We are not able to find affordable/quality loose tea in our community.<br /><br />Lipton's loose tea is the best!
4,"I mix this with the Royal Canin Intense Hairball 34 as well as a no-grain variety - I figure I am covering all the bases this way and not giving the cats more protein than they can handle. They like the Indoor Mature, and the shape is designed to make it easy for an older cat to chew. I wish RC offered this in a larger bag but I'll keep getting the 5.5 lb. size until they do. It's the best formula for older cats that I have found - and best liked by my cats."
0,"It's Twinings.  Just the name recalls merry old England and makes it more of an adventure.  I like the packaging tins, too"
0,"I found this tea to be excellent.  The only reason for the 4 stars, instead of 5, was that I had to resort to a shop vise and a wrench to get one of the 3 containers open. There is such a thing as too well sealed!"
2,"I used to be a huge fan of this.. wild salmon, 4g of protein, other great ingredients.. just ordered another 16 pack and discovered they have reformulated it to be completely different. It is really liquid-y.. impossible for an unskilled/careless self-feeder to have much left on the spoon by the time it gets to her mouth (may be okay for younger babies who aren't self-feeding yet though). Also it only has 1g of protein now - not sure why / if there is less salmon in it? Anyway, it's off the menu here, and I am disappointed to have lost a healthful, convenient option."
1,"I have tried a couple of the other Switch flavors, and I found them to be very disappointing.  This variety, on the other hand, had excellent Kiwi and Strawberry flavors.  However, I emphasize FLAVORS because that is where the Switch drinks get gimmicky.  They are all marketed under the flavors/juices that appear WAY DOWN on the ingredient listing.  The several varieties that I have tried all have apple and white grape juice as the top ingredients.  This seems like false advertising to me, since those juices are clearly not as appealing.  Anyway, this drink is all about the marketing.  The price you are paying for 8 ounces of carbonated juice is clearly an extravagance, and I wouldn't do it again.  Save yourself some money and visit the juice aisle at the grocery store."
3,"Caramilk bars are soooo good.  One of the pleasures of visiting Canada is getting yourself these Caramilk bars.  Along with Aero and Kit-kat, they are top of the line!<br /><br />If you happen to have read the article from the Food/Dining section of the New York Times, dated July 11, 2007, you will agree that British chocolates (and their commonwealth brethren) are da best!"
0,"Tastes like pine needles!!! I've had other earl greys before and never have I thought I was drinking pine needle tea (Another reviewer said it was a bergomot flavor, i'm not educated enough to know)...  I bought this for my wife who can't have caffeinated varieties, and I can say i'm not a big fan.  The English Breakfast decaf is EXCELLENT.  I prefer my tea black, hot or cold, but this earl grey is not tolerable unless drank with a splash of milk and sugar (splenda for me though). It is undrinkable as iced tea.  I'd return this if i could. Avoid this at all costs, young jedi."
2,My one year old loves this product. She eats one every day and never gives me a problem. And I trust the ingredients which reassures me that she's eating something thats good for her.
0,"Twinings Lady Grey has long been my favorite in the Earl Grey family of teas. Lighter with more citrus and floral tones, it's great when you want the taste of earl grey but not as much heaviness. The 6 pack is a good price, so definitely to be recommended. A great loose leaf tea for tea parties too!"
4,"I have 4 cats, and none of them really like these treats. They will eat them eventually, but the certainly don't go wild for them. I do like that grain and chicken free, so they are good for cats with allergies."
0,"I have tried many kinds of herbal teas from different brands. This is my favorite among all the other teas I have ever tried. It is organic, tastes really nice(you have to try it!), and have calming effect. One of the herb used in this tea is gotu kola, I heard gotu kola has an unique vitamin only present in this plant. I take this tea every night before going bed. I feel fully rested in the morning when I get up. I highly recommend this tea."
3,We prefer the Swiss Miss brand K-cup.  This one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate. This is my least favorite of all k-cup brands.
0,Bought a six pack of these and like using it from time to time...it's a natural way to detox...please be advised start off easy with one cup then work up to two cups a day. I usually do this for about 10 days...then go about 2 or 3 months without this tea and then repeat. All natural.
4,"I have a pretty finicky feline. I was a little nervous about trying something new, but it was recommended to me. It has been a huge hit. I don't feed canned food daily, and now she really wants it daily. She absolutely loves it. It is a great price and a great food."
2,"A+ for concept, ingredients, flavor, fun, snack-worthiness. C for function.<br /><br />This product is a great little snack idea and is great to add fruit servings in to your kiddos day. It's a tad tart for my preference but both my 1 yr old and 4 yr old love these. They're these little plasticized foil pouches that have a sort of bottle-like nipple'ish mouthpiece - but free flow - that the kids can suck the product out while squeezing the pouch flat. The mouthpiece itself is under the twist-off cap and is about 1/3 of an inch diameter. They have a permanent home in my go-bag as they do not require refrigeration.<br /><br />BUT they do require a clean-up crew until your child figures out how to use em. WARNING: DO NOT USE FOR FIRST TIME IN A CAR. They're so cute and you're thinking ""oh this is a perfect car snack!"" But they're not until AFTER your child learns how hard they can squeeze em. My 4 yr old was coachable and likely could have been fine unsupervized in a carseat while I drive along. But my 1 yr old? Haha, she grabbed that thing up and WOOP! Up shoots a 3 inch geyser of applesauce-like-product. It was super cute and definitely a home-movie-moment but I'm glad we usually have wipes within reach. Unless you trust your kids to eat super neatly be cautious with this product: no dressy outfits, no papers, no artwork, nothing that can't be wiped down with a moist cloth. This apple cinnamon product in particular I'm not concerned about color stains, but it is sticky and... well, it's fruit.<br /><br />Once my girls got the hang of em it's been great. I even trust my 1 yr old in the car with em - but only when I'm not alone and another passenger can clean up possible 'geyser damage.'<br /><br />I bought this during a special and signed up for Subscribe & Save and the price was far better than in stores (Amazon was ~61% of my stores price). I'm definitely going to keep purchasing this product and try out other pure blended fruit flavors - I'm a little wary of the 'touch of milk' products that require no refrigeration."
0,"I usually don't drink tea because it doesn't have the caffeine kick I'm looking for, but guayusa tea has almost as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. And unlike coffee, it doesn't need to be drowned in cream and sugar to taste good and doesn't have any of the other unpleasant side effects. I usually add about half a spoonful of sugar per cup, which is enough to pleasantly complement the natural flavor. Now if only Starbucks would start carrying guayusa..."
0,"I normally drink loose leaf tea.  However, the Revolution tea bags are amazing!<br /><br />1. They don't fill the bag with dust and fannings. There really are recognizably sized leaves in this bag.<br /><br />2. You can tell that the leaves are decent sized because the almost-clear nylon bag gives you a great view into them.<br /><br />3. They leave plenty of room for the leaves to expand in the bag. It's about 1/3 full, and when you steep the leaves, you can see that they expand and flatten out nicely.<br /><br />Of the two types of Revolution tea I've tried, White Tangerine Tea and Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, the Sweet Ginger Peach is my favorite.  However, I tend to like fruity herbal teas more than straight black / white / green teas.  I like to hand people a bag of the Sweet Ginger Peach and have them take a good whiff. Granted, a lot of teas are simply aromatic, but this tea isn't. It really does have the fruity taste of ginger and peach. I love it.<br /><br />Also, the Sweet Ginger Peach tea makes excellent iced tea.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product."
1,"8.3 ounces and a tad expensive is what I'd say about this drink.34 grams of sugar is also a negative for me. I'm not a sugar lover. All in all not big enough to quench my thirst,and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more.Natural but not that intensely citrus."
1,"Yes, you should order this drink because it does taste great.  (As long as price is no object)<br />Tastes like orange juice with seltzer water.<br />But dont feel guilty about drinking it because it is 100% juice !"
3,"Many reports are coming out about how chocolate is actually good for you, so eat more!  This is the perfect chocolate to do that with.  The varying levels of cocoa are perfect to help adjust your taste buds to eating dark, dark chocolate. It's not an easy transition for a milk/semi-sweet kinda gal, but this chocolate is affordable and so tasty.  I also like that I can just have one (as they are individually wrapped), and choose my %."
1,"After I tasted a bottle of Ocean Spray Cranbery product that was labeled ""100% juice' in big letters and the word ""cranberry"" underneath I realized that it was way too sweet to be 100% cranberry juice.  When I finally looked at the tiny dark red strip at the bottom of the label, I found that it was combined with grape, apple, and other juices.  I called the 1-800 customer info line and asked if I could order the 100% cranberry juice from the website, the customer service representative told me that Ocean Spray doesn't make that product.  When I asked for the percentage of cranberry juicr in the product, she said that she did not have that information.  When I asked where I could find out, she said she didn't know.  Truth in advertising?  Their commercials show funny men standing in cranberry bogs.  Give me a break.  And if you are needing the cranberry juice for your health, be VERY careful."
3,"although this isn't a perfect cup of cocoa, it's far superior to the others that i have tried. i will order this again."
3,"Whole family loves this hot chocolate. We went through the entire box in less than a week. It is smooth, creamy, chocolate delight. And if you combine it with a k-cup of coffee it makes a perfect cafe mocha! Must buy more, more, more..."
2,"My son loved the original recipe Chick Chick but Happy Baby has now changed the recipe.  My son retched upon the first bite of the new meal.  Why do companies try to ""improve"" upon something that already works.  I'm guessing to cut corners somehow (ie. cheaper ingredients).  It's a shame.  I now have a case of the new recipe that won't be eaten."
4,I have two cats. My big boy has eaten these and never had a problem...as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since I adopted him at 2 months. My girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor. Since I treat them equally these are no longer purchased. I hate to see my girl sick so I just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats. If not a problem...carry on.
2,"Great variety of fruits, and my 8 month old loved them all. We bought this assortment pack as well as the vegetable one and it lasted well over two weeks."
0,"First and foremost I am not a tea drinker. I've tried for years to like tea and every tea I've ever tasted was bitter or had some nasty after taste (some were just nasty from the get go). So when I had the opportunity to taste this tea I said why not, maybe this will be different, and sure enough it was.<br /><br />When you first open the container you are hit with this blast of fragrances, ranging from flower like scents, to sweet citrus, something I have NEVER had with tea. I guess I've been drinking (at least trying to drink) the wrong teas...<br /><br />I took a couple of pinches of the tea (about two teaspoons worth) and put it in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CFPXYA"">Norpro Mesh Tea Ball with Cup Rest Handle</a>. After steeping the tea for a minute or so, I took my first taste and OH MY! It tasted nothing like any tea I have EVER had. No bitterness, after taste, or anything, just a very flavorful cup of tea. The citrus/orange flavor from the bergamot oil is extremely flavorful and aromatic, and again NOT the least bit bitter or harsh.<br /><br />If this is how tea is suppose to taste, I've been missing out for years and years and I am glad to say that I am not hooked on loose leaf teas. Move over coffee, I now have a new favorite warm beverage!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Extremely flavorful.<br />No bitter/harsh taste.<br />Organic (if that is something that will encourage you to buy it).<br />A fair trade product (again if that is something that will encourage you to buy it).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Price, though compared to other loose leaf teas it's a pretty good price..."
0,"Lipton Loose Tea, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PC6"">Lipton Loose Tea, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, is a reminder of the way things were when I was a little child.  My mother, all her sisters, my grandmother, and all our friends considered Lipton Loose Tea to be TEA. There was no other for them.  I grew up thinking anything else was an ""off"" brand.  (Lipton Tea is America's favorite tea.)<br /><br />In the South most people make it sweet.  They add the sugar while it is hot so less sugar is required.  Now I prefer to use Splenda (SPLENDA No Calorie Sweetener Granular, 9.7-Ounce Resealable Bags (Pack of 2)) and lemon juice. This tea has a strong black-tea taste.  It is robust and pure.<br /><br />When I moved across the Mississippi River, I was shocked to discover that people in Louisiana drink their tea three times as strong as they do in Mississippi. I think one reason my people liked Lipton Loose Tea so much was that we had very little money and we had to make things go as far as possible.  It was always a good bargain.  Almost any kind of tea is an excellent bargain.<br /><br />Nutritonally it is outstanding.  It is a means of hydrating, which is considered important.  (Always hydrate responsibly:  don't drink too much! You would not want to drown.) Also it is an excellent source of flavonoids, which provide antioxidants. A glass of tea has about half as much caffeine as a cup of coffee.  Since the ingredients vary with different practices, it is difficult to estimate the amount of caffeine.<br />Some caffeine can help many people.<br /><br />On my blog, which you can find at Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook, I talked about my mother's tea and all the spread she used to make when she took food to church for dinner on the grounds.  The name of the blog entry is ""Myrtle's Stuffed Eggs.""<br /><br />About stains -- it is helpful to brush and polish your teeth immediately after enjoying this wonderful tea.  Also, you can clean glasses, pitchers, etc., with baking soda. One more tip is to drink with a straw to try to avoid getting so much of the liquid on your front teeth. (I do this, but I don't think it helps much.)<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful."
1,"I really liked this drink.  It's 100% juice with no added sugar, so even though the sugar content is a little high, it has more nutrients than soda will have any day.  Switch tastes like tangy, carbonated orange drink, and that's fine with me!  I didn't notice any aftertaste, and I could feel safe drinking something fizzy (and tasty, unlike sparkling water) without feeling guilty about it.  But beware - each can is only 8.3 ounces, a little more than a cup.  You decide if it's worth it."
2,"Love this, dont use too much because it is strong, but it tastes great.  Makes even mediocre salmon taste great."
1,"This is a tasty drink with pale pink/purplishcolor. With its carbonation one could call it a drink with bite. For me the taste was good but not outstanding. The aromatic bouquet of Switch is fabulous, but the actual taste, unfortunately, doesn't measure up to that mesmerizing scent.<br /><br />The can's diminutive size lends itself to a quick refresher, not a slake for a heavy duty thirst. It's a good size for a pocket, lunch bag, or purse."
3,"I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon."
1,"I haven't seen this brand in cans before; how exciting!  I know this brand can be hard to find at the store so it is nice to see it being sold here at Amazon.  I am a big fan of 100% juice that has been lightly carbonated and have tried the few brands that are available and Switch is one of my favorites.  My biggest beef with the brand is that it is just super hard to find, which has now been resolved.  I have to say that I don't love the orange-tangerine flavor, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five;  I just don't really like orange flavored drinks but did like how this one had more tangerine flavor than straight-up orange.  I would definintely recommend this brand!"
0,"I think I can call myself a good Turkish Tea drinker. If you are not familiar with any of these teas, choose the cheapest one, which is the Yellow box (Turist) in general. It will give you 80-90% the same taste. The pink/red box (Filiz) is supposed to be the next better one, while it is the most favorite choice for many Turkish tea lowers. The red box (Cay Cicegi) is presented as better and stronger than Filiz, and the black box (Altinbas) is best among these four tea types. However, the prices on Amazon.com are at least double of what you can find at your local ethnic food stores. See if you can find any local stores if possible. Once you find a local merchant, you will find more choices to buy with tea, like Turkish delight, baklava, halva, Turkish cookies, white (feta) cheese, black/green olives, sudjook, and much more. If you come accross Turkish from brands other than Caykur, try to choose Caykur brand."
0,"I drink tea every day after giving up coffee a few years ago. I have a variety of black teas and a few green depending upon my mood that day. When I'm in the mood for something strong, this is my tea. I skip the double pot and just brew up a pot full and store in a carafe. Use boiling water and steep for at least 10 minutes."
4,My cats are very picky but they love this food. It is very dense and provides a large amount of good quality food for my two cats. I especially like the fact that there are garden greens inside the food. It is good for their digestion.
0,I have been a strictly Bigelow earl grey drinker for years and for some reason it has not tasted as good to me lately. I wanted a healthier tea and I really really like this tea. It takes very little of it to brew a cup/pot (and I would also suggest 'Tea Forte' products for brewing).
4,"I have nine cats and they are crazy about these kibbles! The last thing you want is 20lbs of cat food the cats hate, but I'll be buying them more of this..."
2,"I have never had a problem with anything from Amazon.  I have ordered about 30 cases of Earth's best baby food.  This is the most tasty and nutritious variety they offer.  5 grams of protein, and 15% iron! I have it on my subscribe and save.  He can't get enough of this, he eats it everyday!"
0,If you like the flavor of green tea and like your beverage iced you will enjoy this beverage.<br /><br />I like the taste of green tea and I also like the health benefits of green tea.  I mix this with ice water and splenda.  It is a refreshing summer beverage.  I like that it dissolves easily and is packaged in small packages.  It is convenient and easy to use.
0,"The tea was a lot milder in flavor than I was expecting, but still pleasant. The aroma was light. I probably would not buy this again, but that's only because I would like a more intense flavor."
0,"About 8 months ago I ordered a bag of English Breakfast from Davidson's and it was quite good.  Not the best but very good for the price.  After I ran out I decided to order two more bags of the English Breakfast and Assam Banaspaty.  To my great dissapointment, both are old and flavorless.  It seems like Davidson's did not store them properly.  They become bitter quickly if I brew them long enough to get any flavor out of them and I've resorted to mixing it with other tea just so it isn't a total waste.  The reality, is that I wasted $32 on tea that is only really good for making water brown.  : (<br /><br />The quality control issue and randomness of getting a good batch from Davidson's make it not a good value.  I'd rather pay more to know I'm getting consistent quality and not something that might be a total waste.<br /><br />I was really excited when I first discovered Davidson's because I drink a lot of tea and they have attractive pricing but my second order was such a huge let-down that they've lost me as a customer."
1,Title says it all. There really is nothing special about this drink. It's virtually indisguishable from many other carbonated drinks out there. This drink is so average that I hardly even see a reason to write a review about it. I certainly couldn't see going to the trouble to order it over the Internet.
0,"I'm rather conflicted about this product. Granted, it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea (like the ones you get at dim sum places) when brewed hot, however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar. It doesn't taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once it's iced and combined with sugar. The tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light. I need to double or triple the recommended amount of blossoms to get a decent amount of flavor and by then I'm pretty much done with the entire canister. Too pricey for me."
1,"As part of the line of Switch products, Switch Kiwi Berry offers a (slightly) healthier alternative to carbonated soda.  The product is 100% juice, though the majority of the contents are neither kiwi fruit or ""berry"":<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% Juice (Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry and Strawberry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the mix of kiwi and berry flavors in this concoction just does not work for me.  The added kiwi flavor, in particular, imparts a odd sour aftertaste that I just could not get used to.  My children each tried a sip, and for them as well the opinion was mixed.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the Switch Black Cherry (even though the cherry flavor was a bit weak), but I can't be very enthusiastic about this flavor."
1,"While the flavor sounded good, kiwi berry, this is mostly an apple and grape juice based product. It is all natural, but it almost had an herb flavor, like I think of ginseng or something, though it was not included in the ingredients. The carbonation was about right and the flavor is sweet. I couldn't really distinguish the kiwi very strongly, and I wish I had been able to. It's not a bad drink and it is definitely better than many other options out there, but it's not one I'd seek out specifically, probably only buying if it were on sale."
0,"Superb and absolutely delicious. Long a fan of Earl Grey tea and the many varieties associated with it, this delicious blend is now my all-time favorite!"
1,"This product is a waste of money!  It is bitter bitter and salty salty. Save your money and by the peaches instead.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040PYN86"">Libby's Unpeeled Apricot Halves in Pear Juice From Concentrate, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>"
3,"I bought this because it was a very good price.  It was really good though.  I love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoa.<br /><br />Will keep buying this until they don't sell it anymore. It is really creamy.  I like it best with 6 ounces of water, gives it a thicker feel."
2,"There are many reasons to reconsider the first foods we give to babies.  The jars and the plastic containers for processed baby food are often difficult to recycle.  The processed food and the dried cereals (wheat, rice, etc.) are nothing more than empty carbs for a society facing a massive problem with the rise of type II diabetes.  Is this anything to give to a 4 month old baby?<br />To complicate matters, the World Health Organization is now recommending that babies feed on only breastmilk or formula until baby is 6 months.  The reason is that baby's small intestines cannot process the iron out of other foods until baby is six months.  As any parent can tell you, by four months of age, most babies are wanting to try other foods.<br />Nurturme baby food can help with all of this.  Each packet makes up about 2.75 oz of baby food, the same amount in a standard baby food container.  The freeze dried food is combined with breastmilk or formula, so baby can try new foods like peas, apples, squash or sweet potatoes and still get iron a form they can use, while eating a nutritious veggie instead of a starchy carb.  I know carbs are important, but they hardly seem like the best foods to introduce when energy can be supplied from formula or breastmilk.<br />The different foods can be combined to make up baby food, for example apples and sweet potatoes together.  Another versatility option is to add a little bit of nurturme to babies bottle, sort of like a baby food smoothy.<br />The freeze dried packets are super convenient.  They are easier to carry around and store than regular baby food.  After baby is six months, if a parent wanted to add water rather than milk or formula, they can.<br />The baby food tastes good, too.  Normal baby food peas tastes like horrible canned peas.  If you ever wondered why baby wouldn't eat peas, try tasting that nasty food.  The nurturme peas actually taste like fresh peas (yes, i tried them for myself). I tried all four foods in this pack, and they all tasted like fresh food.  I think that having good tasting, healthy food would be much better to introduce than nasty tasting food.  I am trying to develop good eating habits in my child, after all."
2,"I discovered these when my daughter was about 15 months old. I wish I had found them earlier. They are organic, taste great, are easy for toddlers to handle and very convenient! I always keep some in my purse and in the car when we're out and about. They are not messy, unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch, which only happens for us when she's not hungry.<br /><br />The Plum Organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together. They taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies. You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason. Babies R Us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for $1 each if you buy them in sets of 8. That is usually when I stock up for the next two months. :)"
1,"Delicious.  I had to tell you.  This is my first time I've taken time to review a product<br />and I felt like I HAD to, after such a bad review.  ALL of the Blue Sky Free products are<br />very tasty (as far as diet drinks go).  I drank diet drinks for years and gave them up<br />when I found out how toxic the artificial sweeteners were.<br /><br />I kept wondering why someone didn't come out with a diet soda made with Stevia (since<br />it's totally natural and healthy).  Finally, a few makers did.  I've tried several and<br />Blue Sky Free tastes the best to me.<br /><br />It is expensive and hardly ever goes on sale--but when it does, I grab all I can!"
0,"Rooibos Natural Red tea is something of a personal taste! It has an interesting flavor as all things that are good for you do! I prefer to add a little cinnamon to mine. It is known to be used for people who get GOUT and since I do , I have had no incidents since drinking this tea! If it works, use it! It is a good tea and caffeine free. Some prefer it with sugar!Give it a try too for it's calming effect!"
0,"I love this tea and drink it at least twice a day.  The flavor is both strong and sweet.  The tea stands on it's own, never needing sweetner.  If you're a cinnamon lover, you have to try this tea.  And even if you're not, it's worth a try."
3,"After trying several brands of Hot Cocoa my kids have decided that this is the one for them.  I'm certainly happy about it because not only is it delicious, but it's also more affordable.  3 boys can consume a box of hot cocoa very quickly, even with limits set.  It's also very convenient to have it shipped automatically.  If we don't drink that much I simply skip a month.  If friends come over and we drink a lot, I just order an extra box.  It's quick, simple and delicious."
2,Alot of moms like me like this item because our babies have no constapation on it i love it very much.
1,"This is a decent flavored carbonated juice.  It's 100% juice which is good for the more health conscious people.  It tastes pretty good, sweet and a little tangy.  But the flavor does fall short.  Like some reviewers have said, the drink tastes more like a punch than pure orange or tangerine juice.  Do yourself a favor, if you want orange flavored soda, then go for an orange flavored soda.  If you want tangerine, then buy tangerine.  The infusion of both flavors really causes both flavors to fall short slightly short."
0,I love Ahmad tea. The Earl Grey is a wonderful tea for an afternoon sipping. The bergamot flavour isn't overpowering like some other brands I have tried.<br /><br />I will be buying more of this wonderful tea
2,"I got it for my Girlfriend for her Birthday.  The Fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy!  I love dark chocolate, so I loved the dark chocolate almonds.  Next time I'll give the Organic version of this product... to someone close so they share with me  :)"
4,"My cat is a picky eater, but he got excited even before the bag was open (I guess he smelled the meat) and devours the treats. The only downside is the size. I understand this was a ""strip"", but I use them as regular bite-size treats and therefore had to break them into bits by hand (took me a while). I wish Amazon sold bite-size roast chicken treats by this company. I feel good about giving them to the cat, as it seems most cat treats are loaded with bad stuff."
1,"Switch is a wonderful all natural carbonated fruit drink that is made with 100% fruit juice and 100% RDA Vitamin C, with no added sugar or sweeteners.  I enjoyed the kiwi berry flavor which tastes more of kiwi and less of the berry. It is cool, refreshing and a great thirst quencher.<br /><br />The only down side is the 135 calories and the 34g carbohydrate content. However you won't find many all-natural fruit drinks that don't have the same or similar calories.<br /><br />In the end this is a great healthy drink that you and your whole family will enjoy and a healthy alternative to soda pop!<br /><br />I also recommend the Switch Watermelon Strawberry fruit drink, which I enjoyed slightly more than the Kiwi Berry."
0,"after reading the other reviews, i'm confused and don't think that anyone was talking about THIS TEA! (sounded like most comments pertained to prince of peace green tea, and don't have anything to do with the instant dong quai and red date tea that i clicked on...that being said, this is a remarkable tea...it's delicious, it's instant (so you don't have to wait for it to steep) and it's really good for you...i just love the taste of this, but then again - i enjoy the uniquely-bitter flavor of dong quai (but this isn't bitter, it's yummy!)...for those who don't know, dong quai is considered to be ""ginseng for women"" beceause it's very high in vit B12 and helps to keep women from becoming anemic (due the their monthly cycle)...it also is said to help regulate irregular periods, when used on a daily basis...that said, this tea is special because it helps to ""draw one's energy"" downwards (and the red date, adds to this effect in that red is the color of the 1st chakra)...in other words, this tea has aphrodisiac qualities and will create pleasnt feelings when taken before bed (and it's ""good for you"" and it tastes good and it's a snap to make)...so what's there to be quibbling about?"
1,"This orange soda is clearly more healthful, and it tastes tangier, although somewhat less sweet, than other orange sodas.  The one big drawback for me was that this drink lacks caffeine."
1,"For those that want a more ""natural"" soft drink, this is a good option because it has no added sugars. It still manages to pack 140 calories in an 8oz bottle so don't drink this regularly if you're trying to lose weight. The taste has good complexity but like most fruit drinks, is a little too sweet for my taste. I would definitely drink this instead of a typical artificial orange soda though."
4,"Cats love this stuff. One pouch doesn't go far so it is more of a treat than a meal (unless you feed according to recommendations on box).<br /><br />Pouches are easy to open and a little messy, always seems to get on my fingers.<br /><br />My cats come running if they see me reach for the pouch or they hear the sound of flicking it back and forth before opening.<br /><br />All the yucky stuff (think fast food for cats) must be addicting because they seem to listen for the very quiet sound of the rustling pouch.  We give pouches as a treat."
0,"Until you have tried this earl grey tea, you will not believe the difference.  The smell, the taste is so unique that it makes all other brands of earl grey I have tested seem completely ARTIFICIAL tasting.  Enjoy."
1,"Please excuse the beginning of this review being the same as my review for Black Cherry, but the facts are the same.<br /><br /> What is ""Switch,"" a new refreshing drink  that will dazzle you.<br /><br /> The can is colorful, 8.3 oz, not a large drink, and has a catchy saying - ""100% of what you want 0% of what you don't.""  What does that mean?  According to the can there is no sugar added, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, no corn syrup, and it is 100% juice carbonated.<br />Now, this is definitely a break-thru for those with allergies and those looking for a more 'healthy' drink. especially for our children. But it all comes down to one point, how does it taste.  Let's face it, if it doesn't taste good we probably are not going to drink it, and our children definitely will not drink it, and that's just the honest truth.<br /><br />KIWI BERRY SWITCH<br /><br />Now, here is a flavor that I could get use to in a hurry.  This taste was bubbling with flavor and actually brought pleasure to my taste-buds.  It was rich and smooth, yet bursting with excitement at the same time.  It did not leave an after taste that was unpleasant, but left you wanting more.<br />The blending of the flavors in this Switch was excellent and definitely made this taster happy.I had my grandchild take a drink and she absolutely loved it and asked me to go purchase some.  I recommend this flavor. Truly a treat for the taste buds.  Very good."
1,"Now, we're not big juice drinkers in this family.  We take apple juice or cherry juice and mix it with unflavored seltzer water because otherwise we find it too sweet.  This is the same.  It's nicely carbonated, and it has a pretty authentic fruit taste, but it's still too sickly sweet.  Cut it half and half with unflavored seltzer and a little ice and you'll be happy."
1,"I split this can with my spouse.  I would have given it 2 stars, he gave it 3.  Nice idea, 100% carbonated juice, but the taste is pretty mild.  Not really what I would call refreshing.  Good idea, though, I would try it in other flavors."
0,"First of all- I love tea, particularly Earl Grey and variations of Earl Grey...<br /><br />This tea contains Yunnan province black tea and bergamot essential oil.<br /><br />This is a loose tea and the packaging is lovely.  While I have had many loose teas that come in tins, I do appreciate that under the outer cap, this tin has an additional metal stopper that is very easily removed but also prevents an explosion of tea leaves.<br /><br />The stopper not only serves as a seal, it is also useful in measuring the tea for brewing- this little inner stopper holds approximately 1 Tablespoon of tea (not packed, fairly loose...I measured it as I was curious...) which is the recommended amount for 8oz of water and proper brewing... Many folks do not like tea because they have not had properly brewed tea, so this is an impressive extra measure to ensure the brew is as intended...<br /><br />When you open the container the bergamot hits you in the face...I was hoping the overwhelming bergamot would settle down during the brew, but I still found that it was overwhelming to the point of being excessively perfumey (for me it was like being trapped in a small space with someone who bathed in a bottle of eau de anything)... It was quite drinkable when I attempted to get past the bergamot slap, and the Yunnan black tea was smooth and rich and delightful...Not bitter in the least, and very flavorful and tasty... Unfortunately, I could not get past the overwhelming bergamot... But I plan on trying some of Rishi Tea's other varieties as I do like this varietal of Yunnan black tea...<br /><br />I do also appreciate that this is USDA organic, Fair Trade certified and the tin tells the story of the tea and the people who cultivate it...<br /><br />I prefer my Earl Grey to be more balanced, with the tea aspect or the bergamot in harmony...."
2,"Our son loved this.  Great to take with us when we are going out as compared to big bulky and heavy bottles (ie Earths Best baby food)  The only issue we had was that my wife, for some reason, could never open the top.  She would always screw it up somehow.  Easy fix however, just have daddy open it.  Also wish it was re sealable, but our son ate all of the Gobbe Gobble 95% of the time so wasn't an issue.  Overall, very pleased and wish we had tried these out earlier."
0,"Stash Tea Company Cranberry Pomegranate<br />Price: >$4 ordered in a 3 pack less than $10 (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046KO7JA"">Stash Tea Company Autumn Teas Trio Gift Set, 3-Ounce</a> + Free Shipping)<br /><br />Caff-O-Meter: 0mg<br /><br />Ingredients: Hibiscus; Rooibos; Cranberry Flavor; Pomegranate Flavor<br /><br />Received this as part of a 3 pack of teas for the holidays (Cinnamon Vanilla, Pumpkin Spice and Cranberry Pomegranate).<br /><br />-Smell (2) - The smell is not strong, but it is present. I am not a big fan of the smell of cranberry so that may be why the score is low, if you enjoy that smell you may be surprised.<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened:<br />++Hot (1) - Flavor is very bland, if not for the smell I would think I was drinking hot water with the tiniest bit of flavoring.<br />++Iced (1.5) - Tastes a bit better over ice. but a bit thinned down<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (2.5)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) bring out the flavors a bit more, again I'm not a fan of the flavors so that is apparent in this review but the sweetener definitely improves the flavor.<br />++Iced (3.5) -  Better over ice! The flavor is definitely brought out more by the sweetener, would certainly take this over a sugar laden ocean spray cranberry cocktail or something of that nature. I could even see using this as a mixer in some adult beverages the taste is there for it.<br /><br />-2nd Steep (2.5) - When the tea was steeping the second time I was concerned I was in for further disappointment, the color is certainly lighter but the flavor is about the same level.  I always rate this to see how economical a tea is.<br /><br />Summary - My typical everyday go-to iced tea is a blend of hibiscus (for the BP lowering qualities and taste), and other flavors, and I am on a rooibos kick as of late. However as previously stated, I do not typically like the flavors of cranberry and/or pomegranate therefore I would not ordinarily be attracted to this flavor to begin with and am only drinking it because it was included with my order. I will certainly finish the box, but I would not buy it again. If you enjoy the flavor of pomegranate and or cranberry you will most likely enjoy it, and I would certainly not discourage you from it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea)."
2,This is a very good snack that I feel great about offering my 10 month old.  She can easily  pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste.  My 5 year old loves them as well!  I would definitely recommend these to anyone with small (or larger) kids.  :)
0,"Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear ""flavor"". The shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea.  If there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when I drink it. It just tastes like regular black tea.  Very disappointing."
3,"I really like hot cocoa!  I like it sooo much that I have a Cocoa Latte machine, which is great, but sometimes I just want one cup of cocoa not a whole pitcher.  When that happens I used to put on the kettle and heat up the water, then pour in a packet of cocoa mix and stir, and stir, and stir.  And after all that stirring, I'd still get little lumps in my cocoa.  With the K-cups, I get smooth rich cocoa with NO lumps and NO clean-up.  Easy and yummy!<br /><br />Please note: THESE ARE NOT SUGAR-FREE.  The very first ingredient in each flavor is sugar and I did not see any artifical sugar listed in the ingredients.  Each cup has only 60 calories, but if you want sugar-free or are diabetic then this product is probably not for you."
2,"My daughter was not a big fan of baby food, especially any with proteins, but she did LOVE this one! The flavor is just right, not too sweet or too savory, and doesn't have a strong chicken flavor. Almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp, thus it's a very good first protein to offer, and good for picky eaters. My nephews and my niece also liked this flavor, so it's a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you don't know a particular baby's preferences.<br />Something I wish I had known was that it is quite a bit runnier than other Stage 2 Earth's Best, especially for having chicken. I added quite a bit of rice cereal to thicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the runny texture, and she liked that just fine, but it is an extra step. However the runnier texture makes it workable for younger babies or those with gagging/texture problems."
2,"This Beef Stew is fantastic!  It actually tastes like beef stew, no artificial flavorings or colors.  Everything in it is organic and there is quinoa too.  Babies need to be able to taste what real food tastes like.  This product delivers!  All of the other baby beef stews taste like a mystery and loaded with extra ""stuff"" that babies do not need.  It has great portable packaging for moms on the go.  Great price too!"
0,"Okay, not like the butter most people would expect, but a very smooth, full and slightly savory vegetal flavor. The first time you take a sip, you might not notice it, but let it sit in your mouth a bit before swallowing and then take another sip. The more you drink it, the more it will become apparent. It is very soothing to the pallet.<br /><br />Jin Xuan Golden Lily Oolong from Summit Tea Company it a good if not great tea, especially for the price and quantity you get. A solid every day drinker. It is not as complex as some that I've had, but that could be due to how long ago it was harvested and a number of other conditions. Depending on how you brew it, a serving of these leaves is good for 4-5 infusions before the flavor wanes, making it an even better value. And even then, the broth is soft and sweet.<br /><br />If you like your Oolongs more on the green side, then you should give it a try. I know I'll be ordering another tin."
1,"This soda is all natural unlike many others that have artificial flavoring and sweeteners.  That, in itself, makes it ok in my book. The key takeaways from tasting this is that 1. It actually taste like a soda pop and not just juice with carbonation in it.  2. It's as sweet as artificial sodas without the artificial sweeteners. Since it's all natural I guess that's alright.  3. The Kiwi can be a bit overpowering.  So only get this if you really like Kiwis."
0,"I have been fully pleased with Çaykur teas for a while now including other flavors. The Alt'nbe' tastes great in my opinion. It's even good when brewed with a coffee maker, and becomes a very rich and bold flavor."
4,"I bought a couple of flavors from Halo's, both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately. My cats would not touch it."
4,"A few years ago, my cat was diagnosed with food allergies that previously undiagnosed had led to IBD and then Pancreatitis. We went through just about every limited ingredient food to find one he would eat consistently.  He finally settled on Nature's Variety Instinct. Lamb and Rabbit he'll eat every time and all the time. Duck and Venison, he'll also eat just not always.<br /><br />He still suffers from IBD and will have pancreatitis flare ups if given chicken, but his coat is soft and shiny. He's active (at 13 yrs old). And he rarely throws up. I couldn't survive, he couldn't survive, without this food.<br /><br />I'm glad the company finally started to make 3 oz cans. Mr. Picky doesn't doesn't like leftovers. It doesn't hurt as much to toss out 1.5 oz as it does 4 oz."
3,"I found this too sweet. Am hoping there's an unsweetened version available. Not very chocolatey too, kinda like Swiss miss."
2,"I was looking for another dinner to try and decided to spend the extra money on this one.  I thought.. my son loves chicken and mangos so why not this. He is not a fan. He will suffer through half a jar, but will not finish a whole one. I guess it was a little too exotic for his 9 month old taste buds.  We will keep trying.<br /><br />He loves, loves, loves the beef and spinach and will almost cry when the jar is gone."
1,I love the taste of this soda. It's sweet with no bitter aftertaste that can be found in some orange sodas. I'd never guess this was a natural drink from the taste alone.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the serving size. It's correct for a serving size but not what I'm used to in a soda can. (12 oz.)
0,Enjoyable tea with a refreshing taste.  The 16-count Pack of 6 represents an excellent buy compared to store prices.
0,"This tea was a gift. We are down to the last two tea bags, and I had been unable to find it. Alas, it was on the find anything site-Amazon. This particular herbal blend doesn't sound particularly appealing, but one taste and you will be hooked. A smooth, complex blend. Just lovely."
2,"We cannot get enough of Little Duck Organic Snacks. Our little one loves the blueberry. We love the fact that they are totally healthy for baby, and are a fun treat to sneak in a serving of fruit. Not only does baby love them, but mommy sneaks one in every now and again also. Great Product!!"
0,"My family and I have been using this tea for over 40 years.  I make the best unsweetened tea I've ever had with this tea, and get many many compliments on it.  If you use good water, this tea will last for a day or two without refrigeration, which changes it's flavor.  I am in South Texas and we take our tea very seriously down here.  This strong, brisk, hearty brew is just the thing on a hot summer afteroon.  I haven't experienced stained teeth or other ill effects, either.  Using a drip coffee maker to brew it keeps it from overheating and getting bitter.  It's healthy, too, with plenty of antioxidants in it's orange/black pekoe blend.  If you try it and it's too strong, tinker with your recipe.  Once you get the ratio right, you'll find it is delicious."
0,I hardly ever write reviews but this tea is quite excellent.  I decided to try it without any sweetener or any other added taste enhancers.  It is flavorful without being overpowering.  It is a great pleasure to have a fine tea like this loose and reasonably priced.  After the first try I have continued to drink it just as it comes.  You can see by the leaves once they are soaked that it is a premium tea.
0,"I am a big fan of Yogi tea. They make great stuff. Always very high quality ingredients, very tasty blends. This is one of the 5-star varieties. Although it lists itself as chamomile and lavender, the flavor is predominantly a nice licorice, which combined with the other ingredients, is more like anise. It is also a moderately sweet tea. I'd call this a 'rich and full-bodied' herbal tea. And, although I'm not a big ""traditional remedy"" person, there do seem to be some real benefits to this and Relaxed Mind. However, it might be as much due to the enjoyment of a nice hot, flavorful cup of tea, as it is due to the herbs in the tea.<br /><br />Either way, the tea is full of flavor, and relaxing. Enjoy!"
0,"I have been drinking green tea powder for a few years and have come to love the slightly bitter and tannic flavor of it. I decided to try the Stash brand instead of my normal Japanese brand, and it's not even in the same universe. The Stash product is just green colored powder with no flavor at all. Seriously, the Stash brand uses a maltodextrin base and it has dehydrated tea added to it. Real, authentic green tea powder is supposed to be 100% tea, with no additives!<br /><br />If you drink a lot of green tea, you will be very disappointed with the Stash product. I strongly recommend you go with a Japanese brand that contains 100% tea ONLY.<br /><br />I tried to return it to Amazon, but they don't allow grocery items to be returned!"
0,I am just beginning to enjoy loose teas and this was a great introduction. A very good deal.
1,"I'm not a big fan of carbonated juices, but am a huge lover of orange/tangerine.  In that respect, this was a disappointment for me, not being as tangeriny enough for me.  The first sip left me with an extremely unpleasant aftertaste, but had gotten easier to tolerate with additional sips.  But, after waiting a while for another sip, that initial unpleasantness returned.  If I'm going to drink juice, I'll stick to what I prefer, uncarbonated."
3,"This awesome mix is not your usual Hot Chocolate so if that is what you are looking for do not buy this product. But if you are looking for a chocolate that tickles your senses then you definitely want to buy this. The first time I tried it I was not sure so I drank some more, still couldn't decide so I drank some more. So I still couldn't decide so I drank more and then I knew. . . . Ahhhhh What a delicious hot chocolate this is. One that can not be defined.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO651Y"">MOCAFE Azteca D'oro 1519 Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate, 14-Ounce Tins (Pack of 4)</a>"
4,"We have a very picky cat. He turns his nose up to well-loved kitty delights such as Fancy Feast, Friskies, or anything too low-brow for his tastes. He LOVES these treats, which says a lot. You never can predict what your cat's taste buds will enjoy, but I'd recommend these treats on the basis that a) a picky kitty likes them; and b) they don't stink to high hell."
3,"I'm an avid hot chocolate drinker, and this is just doesn't measure up.  It reminds me of the sugar free Swiss Miss.  No matter what size you set your cup on, it's just missing that cocoa flavor.  Maybe the dark chocolate would be better.  I personally like the Cafe Escapes Milk Chocolate better!<br /><br />I bought a 24 pack, and then I was able to find it at my local grocery store, so I bought another one.  Now, I'm stuck with the 24 pack."
0,"If you like me wear and drink black, then this tea is for you. I for the most part keep cautions of fruity teas, I like my tea solid and strong. However this tea had this boldness with a twist of Apricot, which I enjoyed. It is great to break-up a routine of always just black and have some additional flavor to it, and this tea is the one."
1,"My family and I sampled two flavors of Switch -- Kiwi Berry and Watermelon Strawberry.  Though neither is something we'd want to purchase, Kiwi Berry was the least desirable of the two.  It tasted like it had way too much sugar, even though the can claims to have no sugar added.  The strawberry flavor was predominant, overwhelming the kiwi almost entirely.  In all, it tasted like strawberry candy.  Even worse -- it had a kind of chemical-y bitterness to it.  If you want a fruity beverage that tastes a lot like candy, go ahead and try Switch.  But if not -- avoid this.  I would especially not want to buy this flavor.  There are better ways to get my daily Vitamin C fix."
4,I ushally get this curry cat. at the store but they stopped carring it.  It helps me remember the tast of some foods from Germany.  I will shop here again when I need some more.
1,"I have tasted several of the other flavors of this drink, Switch, but I have to say that this one tops them all.  Perhaps it is because I like orange soda, and this drink seems to have all the elements of what I like in the soda without all the harmful ones. There is no sugar added, no preservatives, no artificial colors and it is gluten free.  This is especially great for someone with allergies, or those who are on restricted diets.  Add to that that it is 100% juice and tastes great and you have a winner.  I liked this product and plan to seek it out at my local store."
0,"I hesitated ordering this much tea, but the canisters are nicely sealed to preserve freshness, so it shouldn't be a problem.<br />This gunpowder tea does indeed have a hint of smokiness, but none of the vegetal notes of say a sencha green.<br />It is a very nice everyday tea, which I alternate with white tea.<br />The current sale of 15% off combined with the 15% auto ship discount makes this a real bargain too."
3,"I have been trying to maintain my weight for the last six months, and found that substituting my meals with 2 protein shakes helps me do just that. I enjoy drinking hot drinks because it allows me to savor them longer. I was very skeptical that this would taste awful, but I couldn't have been more wrong. I can't imagine drinking regular hot cocoa again now that I've found one that is actually good for me!"
2,"This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again."
2,I bought these in our supermarket on a whim one day.  I love them.  I have had digestive issues since childhood.  These taste great.  They dont make me feel sick.  I can have my cookie fix without feeling compelled to eat all of them.  My supermarket stopped carrying them so I bought the six pack.  I make them about once a month so the mixes will be used long before they expire.
1,"So, I sampled this SWITCH Orange/ Tangerine Blend. Low on the Carbonation, high on the Orange taste, and worth every sip in Gold! Plus, healthy to boot...Give it a try, and you may discard those ""Brand Names"" once and for all!"
3,"I have tasted several Stephen's Gourmet products, but the Chocolate Raspberry is my favorite. It's creamy, smoothe and delicious.  I consider it my one splurge for myself.  I have a cup every morning and have now shared my favorite beverage with my son, who just cannot get enough of it.  He has created different recipes with it, one using ice cream.  I will stick to the original method.  It's the best hot cocoa mix I have ever tasted.  The aroma alone will draw you in.  I am often asked what is that wonderful smelling beverage.  Occasionally I will share in hopes they will purchase their own.  Stephen's Gourmet makes the best cocoa ever.  I will drink it as long as they continue to make it."
0,"This is a very good tea--it tastes somewhat like an infusion of green tea with a peppermint leaves. It comes from Chile and it reminds me of Yerba Mate. It is natural and has many health benefits--mostly detoxifying the system. All the women in my family drink it and they swear it keeps their system in tip top shape and bc of that, their skin is supple and beautiful. Some of them are between 55-72 and their complexions are flawless. I developed some age spots on my face and have started drinking it on a daily basis.<br />The package contains 12 boxes. It was wrapped well and it arrived on time. The price is extremely reasonable for this product. Thanks!"
1,Good things come in small packages!! This is an excellent non-soda thirst quencher. No sugar but an outstanding taste!!
4,"I like the idea of getting grains out of cat food, but using peas instead doesn't seem to be the answer.  Carnivores (at least my cat) doesn't tolerate peas.  Vomiting began in about 2-3 weeks and is now instantaneous.  Eat some cat food--go right to throwing up. Both chicken and salmon.  So for me it was a waste of money and very disappointing."
1,"I wanted to try this b/c it's made with sugar (or possibly natural fruit sugars) instead of corn syrup. The result was a drink that's a little sweet for my taste but one that most people will probably like. It's 33 grams of sugar per serving; I generally find fruit juices and pop to run about 28 grams of sugar. Then again, that's corn syrup, not ""sugar"" per se.<br /><br />The flavor reminded me a bit of raspberry ginger ale (possibly influenced by its similar color). The smell of the drink is amazing and the consensus in our little at-home taste test was that it smelled better than it tasted.<br /><br />I would definitely try this in a party punch or similar. As for drinking it straight, it was pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised. I would try other flavors and buy this if I saw it in the store."
2,This food is great!  My triplets love it.  I thought it tasted great too!  If I need to go on puree food I want this.
0,"I purchased this tea for someone who enjoys Trader Joe's white pomegranate tea, and unfortunately it was not a good substitute. Though I haven't tried it myself I was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable.  I am rating 4 stars since this is such a subjective judgement, and I have no doubts about this being a high quality product."
0,I bought this at a shop because it sounded good (I love coconut) and it was awesome!  It's become my favorite tea.
3,"This is some of the worst stuff I've ever tried to drink. It's even worse than that awful stuff that comes out of those machines where the cup drops down and fills it. I tried it on the various cup size settings with my Keurig machine and it just goes from bad to horrible when going from the larger size to the smallest.<br /><br />It's a complete waste of money.<br /><br />I just tried another brand that's similar and it's no good either. If you like chocolate water, buy these. If you have it in mind that you are buying ""Hot Chocolate"" with a milky or creamy flavor... that's not what this stuff is.<br /><br />Yuck!"
4,"I have used Fancy Feast for years. When I saw the Marinated Morsals come out, I tried them and no I ONLY get the Marinated Morsels, by request of ""Smoky (my black cat).<br /><br />He loves them and more than the other line.<br /><br /> If you cat is like Smoky, where he much prefers cat food with gravy on it, so that he licks through it and gets his meat with it as well. Plus, if you cat likes the smaller morals of food, like my cat does, then your cat should really like the Marinated Morsals.<br /><br />There have been times I have tried to switch to difference brands, but if the pieces of meat or fish are large for him, he will only lap up the gravy. The Marinated Morsals are his favorite.<br /><br />I keep waiting for my Smok to start talking to me, so I can understand his food choices as well as his philosophy on life :-), but until then, Smokey and the others cats that I have had, have seemed to communicate to me pretty darn well as what they want and have all trained me very well.<br /><br />Jon"
3,"I recently purchased a Keurig and I bought the Cafe Escapes dark chocolate cocoa from their site, and it was not chocolately and had a strange aftertaste.  I saw the Grove Square brand and thought I would give it a try since I got 36 kcups for less than the 24 from Keurig. I received my purchase yesterday and immediately opened it up to try it.  The cocoa actually has sugar in it and the chocolately flavor is much better than the Cafe Escapes. I will be ordering this one again, and I hope my guest will drink the other kind to get rid of it!"
2,"My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!"
0,My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and<br />our family really enjoyed it. I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased<br />with the natural ingredients and no calories.
0,"I actually bought a box in Walmart. It was, needless to say, inexpensive so I thought it was worth a taste test. One cup was Barry's Classic blend(loose), one cup Tetley (bag) and the other was Lipton (loose). Tetley's came in a distant-distant 2nd while Barry's and Lipton were tied for first. Both were very similar in body, richness and strength. A word of warning-don't ever buy cheap (in quality) loose or bagged tea. It will be stems and bits of leaves swept up from the floor-at least that is what it looks and tastes like. The tea should be just leaves as dark brown as semi sweet chocolate. All good (and some bad) tea is grown in Africa, India and Sri Lanka ( Ceylon)."
4,There's an old saying that a bargain is not a bargain if there is no use for the item. While the price of this made it seem a very attractive; it goes to waste since the cats do not eat it.
1,"the orange flavor is pretty good and is carbonated, and its 1/3 the price of what i pay for it at the gym i go to."
0,This tea is the most awful stuff I've ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.  I tried adding sugar and it didn't help. I enjoy the Arizona Pomegranate Gree Tea and would highly recomment it.
1,"Three of us tried it; one of us was barely able to drink it, with ice.  I guess this is, like Evian, an ""acquired taste.""  Unless you're able to try a single bottle before purchase, I recommend you pass."
4,"I do not have human children so I can only comment on how this works for my furry kids. I have a cat with severe pancreas/GI issues & he has steadily lost weight over the past 2 years.He cannot seem to absorb enough nutrients from his foods. He is on B-12 shots & prednisolone to help calm the inflammation & spure his appetite but sometimes the ONLY thing he will eat is this chicken baby food. He has also eaten the ham & turkey versions of this brand but lately...........just the chicken. He's fussy & has always been a ""drama queen"" & he also has allergies in the Autumn that affect his willingness to eat (if a cat can't smell the food a cat won;t eat the food) so getting anything into him is helpful & the baby food is good for both nutrition & for hydration.My husband & I will do most anything to keep him happy & enjoying his quality of life for as long as possible & this baby food helps us do that for him. Our other 3 cats also enjoy this as a sometimes treat so it works well for our family."
0,"Reading the label was an experience in its self.  Great information about the location of the tea trees and the culture around their 1600 year existence.  The tea leaves are appealing to the eye and the hand.  The aroma of the bergamot is strong yet light with a apple, citrus blend that feels like it would be good in any season of the year.  The Earl Grey tea when brewed is quite nice with good strong flavor and the aroma of the bergamot remains for us to enjoy a little longer.  Since bergamot oils have been used to help with stuffy noses and other medicinal purposes, this will work well in Southern California in the Spring and Fall with the Santa Ana Winds that cause so much havoc with our sinuses.  Then, again, in the Winter with flu and colds.<br />The tin has two lids to help keep the freshness in.  The inner lid seems to have more that one job; first is to help you not spill the loose tea everywhere when opening the outside lid.  Then it looks like it might be a measuring cup for use of a 11 ounce mug.  So I tried it and it seemed just right or slightly stronger than I'd like but drank it anyway and felt rejuvenated each afternoon.<br />I have thoroughly enjoyed the bold and smooth flavor of this tea and will look forward to trying other blends in the Rishi Tea line of products."
2,"I agree with a previous reviewer - when it comes to the dinners (just about all of the Earth's Best choices) they are watery and SWEET.  Apples (or some other fruit) in just about everything, and the first ingredient is nearly always water.  I've decided to stay away from these as much as possible and purchase protein-containing dinners from another jarred brand (or mixing my own).  I'd really rather not nurture a sweet tooth at such a young age!<br /><br />The Earth's Best fruits and vegetables for the most part are great - just check the label to make sure water isn't the first ingredient listed (I just love how baby food will have water listed first but then some kind of flour added as well to thicken it up)."
0,"I had never been to a PF Changs before, I found that the food is great but the tea is amzing. I had to ask the manager who their supplier was. My wife and I are now in love with this tea."
0,I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries.
1,"Well, this drink was surprisingly tasty. The reason it was surprising because there is no sugar added. It's ""100% juice carbonated"". It was like drinking a soda but it was a drink of juice that is carbonated. This would be a good drink if you want a healthy drink that is carbonated.<br /><br />Now I'm curious about the other flavors to see if they taste better. However, I do have to say if you're expecting something extremely sweet, this is not the drink to get. You may want to go buy Kool-Aid for that. This drink has a natural taste to it. I can actually taste the mixture of orange and tangerine. I wish the tangerine flavor was stronger, because I like tangerine more than orange, but considering the fact that there is no sugar, it's a good drink."
3,I rather enjoy mexican hot chocolate and am used to getting the thicker ground Ibarra style version.  The ingredients are quality and it makes a good drink appreciated by guests but unfortunately is not exactly what I wanted.
0,"This tea is excellent, it has a delicious flavor, and it smells really good. I have to write twenty words.. so, I will just say, buy it with confidence, you won't regret."
4,"First off, my cats loved the food. One of them has had issues in the past and I need to be careful with what I feed him, and this seems to work well. However, about half the cans were your normal, semisolid cat-food consistency, and the other half were incredibly runny and nasty looking. They ate both kinds with equal gusto so I don't think anything was wrong with it, per se, but I still found it a little concerning. I'm ordering another batch, and we'll see how that turns out."
1,"Since I love both strawberries and kiwis, I thought this one would be perfect for me. Well, I was wrong. It basically tastes like bubbly fruit punch, not exactly strawberry kiwi. Looking at the ingredients list, it shouldn't surprise.... it's a mixture of fruits, kiwi and strawberry being on the bottom of the list.<br /><br />I do recommend the cherry Switch drink, but that's the only one out of three that I liked."
0,"The scent upon opening this can of loose Earl Grey Tea is delicious in and of itself but once brewed....it's amazingly scrumptious!!  I like tea but I've tried a lot of varieties and brands only to find many have weak flavors (despite their initial scent) or are bitter, especially if too much tea leaf is used.....but not this one.  I experimented with different quantities of leaves in the same size cup and each and every cup ALWAYS tasted fantastic with great flavor and NO bitterness.  Of course it's the Earl Grey flavor which I love but I will be trying Rishi's other flavors after drinking this one.  If you are a tea lover and like this flavor, give this one a try....you'll like it!"
4,"My cat is very picky and this is the only hairball remedy that I can give him that he eats and it works!  I don't have a problem with him vomiting at all.  I give him about 8-10 treats per day (and you have to make sure that you are giving them on an empty stomach), and the hairballs pass through his system - he never spits them up.  I used to purchase them at the store, but they stopped carrying this specific type and only sell the hairball/tartar control combo ones now - my cat hates them.  So happy to find these online!"
2,"Yes, I am 37 years old and addicted to scooby doo fruit snacks! I have always liked fruit snacks and buy them from time to time.....but this is the firsat time I have ever bought a case. They are that good, and no other fruit snacks, even by betty crocker, can compare. try it, get hooked, brush teeth!"
3,My family really enjoys Grove Square Hot Cocoa Milk Chocolate and we keep a supply on hand.  The excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us continually renew our order.
1,"This is a great soda that's not really soda. If you want natural kiwi and berry flavors, buy this item."
1,I enjoyed the carbonation with a hint of blackberry and liked the fact there are no calories or artificial sweeteners.
0,I love the chamomile tea. Its sweet and mild. Its excellent for a bed time tea.
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry is one of the most refreshing drinks that I have ever tried. It is 100% pure kiwi and strawberry juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious. Right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there. After drinking it, you may never go back to regular sodas again. It works well by itself or with a meal. This may be an ideal substitute for sodas for kids, as it is a much more nutritious drink. The only problem that I have is the size of the can. At 8.3 ounces it may be enough for a kid, but you would need more than one of these to quench an adult's thirst."
3,Great tasting product and is much better than other cocoas I have tasted in this type of single serve. Job well dont grove square!
1,This drink is a great alternative to soda. It has a little bit more sugar than soda but this has better ingredients than a regular soda can. It is a little pricey for a pack of 24 but it is better for you and it taste great.
0,"It's hard to rate tea. It's very good tea, but tea nonetheless. However, the company that sells this particular tea was very nice to deal with. They shipped the tea very quickly. I'll most likely buy from them again when the need arises."
0,"I've been a connoisseur of fine tea for many years.  Yet, I can no longer afford to frequent the fine tea rooms and tea stores that I used to, which offered my favorite varieties and international brands.  Subsequently, I've had to settle for lessor quality brands sold in most major supermarkets.<br /><br />Knowing how much I enjoy superior tea, my daughter-in-law chose Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a holiday gift.  I could not have been more pleased!  *I regret that I delayed writing this review. Yet, with Mother's Day approaching, I'm hoping for another gift set.<br /><br />Bentley's Royal Green Tea is a superb collection of fine tea which is equal in quality and taste to some of the world's best green tea I've enjoyed.  This elegantly wrapped gift-set offers 6 varieties of special blends of green tea and fruit blends, from exotic fruits to popular favorites, such as Mango or Raspberry.<br /><br />Each teabag is securely sealed in a beautifully designed packet, with an elegant artistic image representing the fruit which flavors that teabag.  Bentley's goes further by providing a sturdy wood-like case, designed with 6 separate sections, each section containing 6 teabags of one flavor.  This solid well-designed dark-green case holds a total of 36 individually wrapped tea bags in its six compartments; a case which aptly resembles a jewelry box for the true 'jewels' of exquisite fine teabags it holds.  Indeed, when you lift the firm lid on this elegant case of fine tea, you will know you have a treasure-chest of great varieties of fine green tea.<br /><br />I was especially impressed that each teabag was expertly measured and prepared to effect the perfect aroma and optimal taste for the average teacup.  No other green teabags comes close to the perfect brew one would expect from the finest loose tea sold in specialty tea stores and tea rooms.<br /><br />Whether you purchase Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a gift, or for your personal use, you will not be disappointed by the suburb quality of this wonderful selection of fruit-flavored green tea.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />April 2, 2012"
0,"I am addicted to this TEA!! I love Yogi Teas because of their inspiring sayings on each tea bag's tag... and this ORGANIC tea is SO delicious! It is so tasty and sweet, there is no need to add anything to it! It is perfect all by itself! I drink at least a cup or two a day of Breathe Deep. It keeps me feeling happy and breathing fabulously :)<br /><br />There is no sugar in it, but whenever I have a craving for something sweet, I just drop one of these tea bags into hot water! No calories, no added flavors or sugars, no guilt and the world is happy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea to anyone interested in finding a tasty new drink that is all natural and ORGANIC!! It seems too good to be true, but Yogi is awesome! Oh yeah, and if you have a head cold or congestion, this tea works wonders as well -- I love drinking it, even when I feel 100% healthy though!"
2,"I loved the stage 2 Spinach Mango Pear, although I found it too watery.  I had to add rice to get baby to eat it.  I got the stage 3 mama grain based on the fact that it is suggested for 7 month olds.  My baby is 9 months old and won't eat it.  I disagree that it tastes awful.  I'd eat it myself, but it is way too thick.  I got a case of it, so I'm going make it work.  So- I put the too watery stage 2 spinach mango pear and stage 3 mama grain in the blender and voila! Perfect texture.  Easy enough fix, however- I buy premade baby food because I don't want to blend my own.  I did with my 1st baby, but this is my 4th, and the novelty of making baby food, and the time required to do it- is long gone.  Happy Baby would do well to be more consistent in their labeling.  Their Stage 2 food should be 1.5, and this stage 3 should be 3.75."
4,"This is a new line for Friskies and is not a ""treat"" as the title implies. Just another can of cat food to try! My female loves this stuff, can't wait to get it in her dish, and gets quite angry whenever she gets anything else but this or the tuna variety. My male, forget it!  He loves the shredded turkey and cheese but won't go near this one.  Weirdest thing in the world to me - thought he'd go gaga over it like he does his turkey, but he just won't touch this stuff.  Anyway, this is a bit pricey here so check around for a better price.  At least in Ohio it's a bit high!  Highly recommend!"
0,"Zen brews up to an golden amber liquor. The aroma is sweet spearmint. The blending of this tea is excellent--spearmint could be overpowering but they use just the right amount of it. Slightly sweet spearmint is the primary flavor, then you taste a hint of lemon. The green tea provides an herbal base for these two flavors that makes the intial impression of zesty spearmint and lemon modulate into a substantial potion. Very nice and satisfying with a clean spearmint aftertaste.<br /><br />Remember that this tea does have caffeine--however, it does not say how much on the box. A good estimate might be 30 mg--compared to 90mg for the average cup of coffee. Make sure you time how long you brew this tea because if you brew too long it becomes bitter. Four minutes is ample."
2,My 1 year old loves these! Great snack! I've tried to find these at my stores and can't seem to get them very often. Love that they are organic and my one year old loves that Elmo is on the box!
1,"My family and I love Switch! It's delicious and healthy - all juice and not all the added sugar that comes with other carbonated drinks. Switch used to come in bottles, but the cans are much more convenient and easy to recycle. The Kiwi Berry flavor is my favorite flavor, but all of the flavors are very tasty."
1,"As posted in the ""black cherry"" review, 33 grams of sugar is way too much for me but may be great for others who can handle high sugar content.  The kiwi is a refreshing taste but I could only drink a small amount because of the sugar.  Cute little can - much smaller than the typical soda size."
0,Great aroma and fine taste. I am so happy with Amazon's subscribe and save price on this. This is our household's favorite. I wish I could find this in loose tea format.
0,"Everyone in my house is addicted to this tea. We drink it iced. Make one or two pitchers of it a day. It's not sweetened, but has a subtle, natural sweetness to it. Feels refreshing and clean. It was also one of the few things I tolerated well when I was pregnant and routinely nauseated. I've heard this from other mothers too. Love it."
4,"I thought this is a pretty good food, and a great value for the money. As the previous review stated, it contains a bit too much grains and byproducts.<br />I was really surprised by the kibble size. It's too big! I thought first I received dog food by mistake; re-read the label - no, that's cat food. Wow, way too large for my cats' little mouths. They seem to have fun with it, though - crunching on the pieces (good teeth cleaner at the same time?).<br /><br />However, as two of my cats can be considered seniors, I will have to switch to a different food, something with smaller bits, to make it easier for them."
2,"While I worry that I am teaching my baby to be a snacker, these are perfect for the in-between times for my 1 year old grazer. The label tells me that they are a healthier choice for my baby than the typical grocery store aisle alternative. I like to keep these in the car and diaper bag for helping to calm my little one while waiting for meal, etc. I don't think they taste awesome, but he sure eats them like they are going to disappear. That makes me happy!"
1,"I purchased this 24 pack of Big Ass soda and only got 23. Immediately I was all like ""Oh man, this is gonna suck!"". Regardless of the quantity error though, it sure kicked some red.<br /><br />Everyone in my town absolutely loves it. I highly recommend along with other soda, Voltages.<br /><br />-Malcom"
1,"Refreshing orange juice drink with a good kick to it. If you drink this first thing in the morning with breakfast, it's sure to be a real eye-opener! It's a ""juice"" drink, not soda pop. But it is carbonated, so it has the same bubbly, zesty fizz. The tangerine taste is better than Switch's black cherry. I would definitely buy a whole case of this orange flavor. Highly recommended!!"
0,"Not a connoisseur by any stretch, but tea is whole leaf and tastes good.  Considering the Twinnings tins in the store give you about 1/5th the amount for the same price (and it's tea leave dust) this is all the more valuable.  1lb lasts a while so maybe portion into zip top bags for longer storage.<br /><br />Not sure how folks cannot make a strong cup of tea with this product. It has the capacity to make rocket fuel if you use too much."
2,My son loves the Best Earth's baby food and his favorite seems to be the Vegetable and Turkey. He smiles at every mouthful.<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way. All the food I feed my son is through Earth's Best.
0,"I first tried these powdered green teas from Stash last summer. This spring I wanted more, but the store I got them from didn't think the vendor would be carrying any.  I was delighted to find that I could get them from Amazon. I ordered a whole bunch and look forward to having refreshing REAL FOOD drinks all summer in an easy to make form."
4,"I have two cats, one who eats wet food as a last resort (mostly she licks up the gravy), and one who has food allergies (grains) and is incredibly picky (won't eat any grain free cat treats i've found so far--greenies, the tasty junk food ones, wellness cat jerky bits, shaved salmon, etc-- doesn't like catnip, and turns his nose up at anything that costs less than $1.29 a can it seems, to include spots stew; authority; organix; most flavors of avo-derm, holistic select, and innova; max cat; and natural choice).<br /><br />she still licks up the gravy, and eats about half her bowl. He eats his portion and finishes hers, with no vomiting or retching (so nice!). He also wakes me up in the morning if it's breakfast time and i haven't gotten the memo yet, and looks at me like i just kicked his grandma cat when i've run out.<br /><br />this has quite a bit of juice in it, which is good since most cats don't drink enough water anyway.<br /><br />as for me, i love this food b/c it doesn't smell to high heaven, and i haven't died from litterbox duty as of yet. ;) (get it? duty--dooty? hehe)"
1,I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  I'm actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Don't trust the FDA!!
1,"Kiwi Berry is the fourth Switch flavor I've tried.  Only one of the flavors (tangerine) tasted like the fruit on the label; the others (Black Cherry and Watermelon-Strawberry) tasted like carbonated apple juice to me.  So, when I opened this, I wasn't quite sure what I'd get.  I'm happy to report that this tastes like fresh kiwis and berries.  It's sweet enough, without being too sweet, and it has plenty of carbonation.  This, along with the tangerine flavor, will be a favorite of mine."
0,"I think this is a great green tea powder.  I add this powder to a 24oz water bottle and it has a nice light taste, I prefer it unsweeted so that I may add a sweetner if needed.  Great price for the quantity and the quality of the product."
2,"I generally make all of LO's food organic from scratch (yes, I work full-time, but this is important to me, so I make the time).  However, I've tried a few pre-packaged foods...and while LO loves the taste of Chick Chick, and I like that it is more well-rounded than most others, I absolutely hate this packaging.  If my little one decides he doesn't want to finish the package after three bites, the rest is total waste...or I have to scoop it into a different container to store until he's ready to finish.<br />Absolutely love the item, but hate the packaging."
1,"Switch Orange/Tangerine is billed as the natural alternative to sodas and/or artificially-sweetened juice drinks.  However, I found it to be pretty ordinary.<br /><br />First the good stuff: It is 100% Orange & Tangerine juice, has no sweetners, is 100% natural, has 100% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, and has a nice carbonation tang to it.  If you are health conscious and want to drink something like a soda w/o actually drinking a soda, this would probably be right down your alley.<br /><br />However, I found the taste to be somewhat... odd.  I could definitely taste the tangerine in it mixed with the orange, but the combination of the two or the bottling or something gives this Switch a taste akin to eating an orange that is ALMOST too ripe.  You know that kind of fermented taste of an orange that you need to eat NOW because by tomorrow you'll need to put out for the birds?  Not exactly something that I'd look forward to drinking.<br /><br />So for me, although this was somewhat good, its not exactly something I would get again.  I'm not really a health nut so if I wanted an orange soda, I'd just go out and get an Orange Crush."
0,I am sensitive to Caffeine and supposedly the White teas have 1/3 approx. what Black teas contain. And about half of what the green teas contain. This probably varies all over the place however. Often a decaf tea isn't. If you want no caf you need to look for caf free teas and drinks. I find a kick to this white tea but it definitely is not as bad as some of black teas. My husband and I can't tolerate a lot of tannins and this seems to be high in them as the other reviewer mentioned it's astringent properties. But we temper that with milk or 100% Cranberry Juice concentrates as well as lemon juice or powdered. Good both hot or iced. Looking forward to making sun tea for ice tea with these bags. Look on the net this item is cheaper as are all the Prince of Peace items else where even after paying shipping which is usually reasonable. I hope they don't up the price just because everyone else's white tea is higher. I wish it was available in a loose tea too. A smooth flavored good tasting tea that reminds me of teas I had as a child and at Chinese restaurants. Beats anything I can buy in local supermarkets.<br /><br />I did try the organic version and no way. This one is better for some reason. Stronger and overall a better product even the bag it'self is better than the organic's.
2,"IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST HAPPY BABY PURCHASE, TRY AGAIN, THE REST ARE AMAZING! I love Happy Baby. My daughter eats this companies products all the time.  Chick Chick is great, Beef Stew is wonderful, but Gobble Gobble is weird.  My daughter didn't mind the taste, but I could not get over the texture.  It looked like a giant blob of wet dog food.  It was more putty-like than any other flavor.  I actually had to cut bites off of it.  I am grossed out just thinking about it.  Good thing there are other flavors."
1,"I decided to try ""The Switch"" orange tangerine because it was promoted as a drink that is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all-natural and it happens to be carbonated.<br /><br />The taste is like drinking orange juice at first with carbonation and I have to be truthful, at first I wondered if it was an alcoholic beverage at first.<br /><br />But after tasting it, you do taste the combination of the orange tangerine and the carbonation.<br /><br />The drink contains no sugar or corn syrup and no preservatives.<br /><br />Overall, a tasty carbonated beverage with only 140 calories and no fat.  15mg of sodium and 36g of carbs.<br /><br />If you are interested in the beverage that combines the taste of juice and carbonation, give ""Switch"" a try!"
0,"Just got my teabags today, and the first bag I made tea with... the part of the teabag where the string is connected to the bag tore across the bag after seeping.  The bag remained intact though. The second bag, while unwrapping the teabag... the tag ripped the bag right open.<br /><br />The tea tasted fine, not very strong like most other oolong teas.  The quality of the tea bag is like some flimsy material.  Two out of two broke... I guess I need to be more careful with the others."
3,"I have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find Grove Square to be about the best of them all.  I usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers, my favorite being the Sugar Free Caramel Macchiato.  By adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories."
1,"My baby likes it but I think it's too much sugar. It's made from concentrate, so it tastes artificial. Try fruitables instead. It has vegetable and fruit juices, less sugar, and tastes much better. Good price on Amazon."
4,"You have to understand, kittens need things like bones and shards of feathers and meat. That's what cats eat!<br /><br />For people to complain about the ingredients? For this? I see someone going behind and reading the label as some form of justification and I have to wonder if they know what kittins eat in the wild. This is formulated specifically for kittens too small to eat chunks o<br /><br />The kitten I have loved Fancy Feast Appetizers, just raw meat with juices from the meat. SHE LOVED IT. I had to get her to start eating this so I mix in the Fancy Feast Appetizers (mostly fish apps) with this and she LOOOOOOVES eating this now. one can of this mixed with two viarities of Fancy Feast Apps and that should do it.<br /><br />So you can mix this in with something else, kitten formula, a little water, and this mushy but soft food will adapt and work with what you put in it.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for people who want to feed their kittens, even if you can't get them to eat it. Whatever is in this, it's making my kitten super healthy. She has grown out of this food and now is ready for Royal Canin Canned Cat Food, Kitten Instinctive."
2,"My husband and I both tasted the peas today and they were delicious!  Huge step up over other baby foods we've tried!  Just wish there were more flavors to choose from...<br /><br />However, we've stopped buying this product based on Amazon's RIDICULOUS amount of packaging for it.  One of the reason I liked this product was that I felt greener using a baby food without the glass jars.  However, in order to ship 32 packets of powder, Amazon put the 4 small boxes of 8 powder packets into a bigger box, surrounded the bigger box with plastic padding, and put that box inside an even bigger box!  As if they were worried the powder packets would break?!  See the attached picture.  We bought it ~4 times and same over-kill packaging every time.  Even if you're not concerned about the environmental impact, it was annoying to break down and dispose of that much packaging just for a few things of baby food."
3,"I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate."
0,"I can't say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea.  The bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk, sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary.  The color and aroma are just lovely, making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker, and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery.  I carry the bagged variety everywhere I go."
1,"Bottled like an energy drink, Switch, doesn't contain the things you'd find in other carbonated beverages. There's no sugar, no caffeine, no corn syrup, no preservatives or artificial colors.<br /><br />Instead, what you get is a refreshing, all-natural, lightly carbonated tangerine-orange drink loaded with Vitamin C. Think of it as orange soda without all the things you don't want. Switch has just the right amount of carbonation to make the beverage refreshing without being filling.<br /><br />It's a zippy beverage made with real tangerine, apple, and grape juices, and would make a refreshing beverage, lunch, dinner, or snack-time drink.<br /><br />There was a slight aftertaste that I'm chalking up to either the can or the citrus, but it didn't get in the way of enjoying the drink.<br /><br />Make the ""switch"" to Switch."
2,I love milk & only organic milk & Horizon is my favorite & these little cartons are great for on the go if not opened can be does not spoil long as not opened great for on the go & packing for a trip
1,"This is marketed as healthy all natural all juice.  From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice concentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.<br /><br />As to taste: This was close to what I was expecting, but surprisingly sweet.  I could taste the kiwi and berry.  The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.<br /><br />I tasted this flavor as well as the ""black cherry"" flavor.  I didn't like black cherry, but I liked this and would have it again.  If the concept of carbonated fruit juice appeals to you, then<br />this is a good flavor to start with.<br /><br />Here is the nutritional information:  8.5fl oz., 135 calories, 0g fat, 15 mg sodium, 34 g total carbs, 33 g sugar, 0g protein, 100% vitamin C.<br /><br />ingredients:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acis (vitamin C)"
3,"The Green Mountain Hot Cocoa is a good choice for a nice quick cup Hot Chocolate from our <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA"">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>. Here are my observations:<br /><br />+ Good on ""Small Cup"" size, a little weak on the ""Large Cup"" setting<br />+ Shakeup the K-Cup before using (a good tip from another reviewer)<br />+ My wife and kids really enjoy it with peppermint Coffeemate flavoring added<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
2,"it took about a month for my 11m to start liking this salmon pouch.  the price is great, about a $1/pouch.  its very easy to take with you when traveling since no heating or mixing required. just open and put a spoon in it.  i will probable keep giving this to her past her 1st b-day."
0,"Look at the ingredients...it is made with Black Tea...Google Black tea and Fluoride and you will see that black tea is LOADED with fluoride because it is made with the oldest part of the tea plant it contains the highest level of fluoride of any tea. Fluoride is not healthy for anyone. If you want a healthy natural tea, get one that is made with white tea leaves. White tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much, much , much less fluoride than either black or green teas."
1,"I love juice and I love carbonated beverages, but it is difficult to see this product having a long retail life.<br /><br />Essentially, this is a good drink that doesn't really do anything well.<br /><br />It doesn't taste good enough to be a juice replacement--and is there really a need for a juice replacement?  It might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers.<br /><br />It's not exactly a post-workout recovery drink.  Juice would be better.  Minute Maid juice, for instance, has less sugar and carbohydrates, even though Switch doesn't add any sugar.  And there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients, including Calcium and other vitamins and supplements, including potassium.  So, it's less healthy than most juices.<br /><br />Switch isn't exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks.<br /><br />As a regular alternative to sugared soda, it tastes good, but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit-based sodas.  And, $22 a case, it's more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans.<br /><br />So, in the end, Switch is worth a try but likely not something you will habitually buy."
1,"Switch Orange Tangerine is ok but not what one might expect.  First of all, there is more apple and grape juice in here than orange or tangerine (this will not be a surprise if you are familiar with the other flavors as that is also true with them).<br /><br />Switch basically is carbonated juice.  The taste isn't a bad and it is supposed to be healthier than soda (which can be debated).  It is a reasonable drink for snacks but if you are going to need several if you are actually thirsty."
3,I love Stephen's Gourmet Hot chocolate.  It arrived quickly and we have been enjoying it for at least a month now.
0,"A little education in Ayurveda - In Ayurvedic principles, the Kapha 'element' is said to be similar to clay (elements of water and earth). It helps to hold our constitution together and provides structure, fluid balance, endurance and strength. It is the slow, stable, calming, sweet and cold aspect of the self and governs our resistance to disease and promotes self healing.<br /><br />An imbalance in kapha leads to respiratory illnesses, excess cough/cold symptoms, weight gain, general feeling of laziness/heaviness.<br /><br />Kapha tea is an excellent antidote to a kapha imbalance - the tea itself is spicy and invigorating with strong notes of cardamom, ginger followed by cinnamon and lemon verbena.  It's spicy, complex and my new favorite!  I ordered a bodum tea press so I can brew this tea at work."
3,"I just got a Keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee.  I didn't have super high expectations, but these are absolutely awful.  There is a very strong plastic/chemical taste to these k-cups.  I tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help.  The only reason I gave these k-cups 2 stars is because my boyfriend can ""tolerate"" them, but I don't trust him because he'll eat just about anything.  In his opinion they are ""not that good"" but he will still drink the mug.<br /><br />From what I've read of other hot chocolate k-cups, you'd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way!"
2,"So bad, I returned it. My children didn't even like it, and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food."
3,The pocket coffee I ordered is by far the best chocolate I have ever had and am now sharing it with my friends.
0,"That is right, open the bag and just get your nose close and smell it. You know this is a quality product instantly. Some of the tastiest tea I have had and the Oolong and orange are a great mix. Even if you aren't a tea drinker at all, once you smell this tea you will want to try it. I am very glad I bought this product it is a favorite of mine."
0,"The fennel smells fresh, tastes good, and makes a great addition to one of my tea blends. It is packaged exactly as shown in the picture. Came in a timely manner. Thanks!"
1,"Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks<br />  no caffeine<br />  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)<br />Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)<br />  can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it<br />  lots of calories<br /><br />I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor."
2,"These are sort of like brownies.  A little soft, a little dry.  My 7 year old really likes them.  They're good if you are on a restricted diet, but otherwise nothing too special."
0,"This tea was a major disappointment. I had been used to drinking the Assam from Teaism in DC and was looking forward to buying this variety of Assam in bulk to save money but it ended up being a waste of money. There is no flavor no matter how long you steep it or how much you use. It gets two stars because it does not taste bad, there just is no taste."
1,"I think I liked a similar drink but this one is just there. It's bubbly. It's sort of orange flavored. It has a sharpness but there's nothing about it that excites me. It's a good old fashioned carbonated beverage and if it's inexpensive buy it. If it's significantly more expensive than most drinks, leave it. Buy coke instead."
4,"I was sold that this product is great for gereatric cats, but not really. My 17 yr old cat can not keep this down. Vet feels because of the unknown source of grains she may continue to vomit up this food. If your cat is real old like mine I suggest trying a grain free food. Cats are carnivores so grains are only fillers in these types of foods. 2 stars for fast shipping"
1,"I'm not much of a soda drinker, but I enjoy a good natural fruit soda in the summertime. Izze describes their sodas as ""100% Pure Fruit Juice and Sparkling Water"". That's an exaggeration, as there are a few more natural ingredients beside fruit juice and water in these drinks. But the description is apt in that Izze's drinks are more sparkling fruit juices than sodas. They are lightly carbonated, not super-fizzy. And the best of them taste like fresh fruit. The Sparkling Grapefruit will be a fast favorite of grapefruit fans, because it tastes like fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice, but lighter and a little sweeter. It's a little tart. A little sweet. A little fizzy. Very refreshing. It's like drinking fresh grapefruit juice, only better. There's never any trace of sourness. No refined sugar, artificial ingredients, or caffeine either. 12 fl.oz. glass bottles.<br /><br />Ingredients: sparkling water, grape juice concentrate, grape fruit juice concentrate, lemon juice concentrate, natural flavor, gum acacia (from acacia trees), ester gum, red cabbage extract (color). One serving (which is 8 fl.oz.) contains 10 mg sodium and 25 g total carbs."
1,"While orange juice is the fourth ingredient in this drink,  the dominant flavor is a muddy orange which is backed up by a low level of carbonation.  I think that the use of the inexpensive apple and white grape juices as the first two ingredients (tangerine is third) is what results in the unpleasant muddied orange taste. Finally they threw in a bit of acerola juice but to no avail.  To my taste this stuff is suprisingly unpalatable.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice.  The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit.  Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you."
0,"First of all, the tea is gross. It tastes nothing like bubble milk tea. secondly, the seller must know this product is less than expected because they sell it in incriments of two (2.2lb) bags. NOW IM STUCK WITH TWO BAGS (4.4LBS) of this junk. I want my 30 bucks back."
3,"Well, I love hot cocoa but this is truly different. It literally has bits of candy cane mixed into the cocoa mix and it is a refreshing ""warm you from the inside out"" hot cocoa drink. If you are someone that isn't sold on peppermint in your hot cocoa you just have to try it. The peppermint is very subtle but very pleasing to the palate. Truly different from any hot cocoa that I have ever enjoyed."
3,"This is a great way to stop wasting money on creamer.  We use creamer in cocoa and it's always been an issue for kids on how much to use.  With these little cups, that don't need to refrigerated, we have cut back on over creaming cocoa and wasting of creamer.  The creamer comes in one big box; I was expecting a box within the box.  I would recommend keeping a supply in the frige to help cook the cocoa when making it."
4,"I have 2 female cats. I have given them other Friskies food before, but this is the first time with the ""indoor"" type and with this flavor.  When I gave it to them they ate it much quicker than they normally eat their food and were licking the bowl to get every last bite. I know different cats prefer different food- for example, if I give my cats food that is not the pate kind they won't touch it- so it may not work for all cats but it was great for mine."
2,"I wondered why my 10-month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren't so promising.  Then I noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids.<br /><br />Here's the ingredient list: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Mango Puree, Organic Finely Ground Chicken, Organic Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Split Pea Flakes, Calcium Carbonate.<br /><br />Anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet, and this one is sweet.  The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.<br /><br />I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.<br /><br />These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth's Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is broken, but I don't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price."
1,"The flavor of this reminded me somewhat of candy, but I can't recall which one. It's fruity but not too sweet. I'd give this to my kids over a regular sugar laden soda.<br /><br />Ingredients include: 100% (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry juice concentrates) natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)."
3,"Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured.  New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia, etc.  This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England, Australia or New Zealand Cadbury.  It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently.<br /><br />If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey version.<br /><br />Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA."
3,I have tried different brands of hot cocoa from dark to milk and the Grove Square milk chocolate k-cups have by far been the best.  They're big critics in my family and they have given two thumbs up.  I would recommend anyone who enjoys hot cocoa to purchase this brand.
1,"The first sip gave a pleasing flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />When trying the kiwi flavor, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. ""100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.""<br /><br />2. ""Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.""<br /><br />3. The logo has ""THE"" placed upside-down and reversed, atop ""Switch,"" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)""<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI"">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that other flavors also have acerola in them).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink... WITHOUT, thank God, SOYBEANS added!!<br /><br />I'm hooked!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several Kindle books and Amazon Shorts<br /><br />P.S.<br />With chagrin and apologies I've had to add comment updates here"
4,"I have a cat with a heart condition that takes meds. twice daily. This is a little loose off the shelf, but after refrigeration it is perfect to wrap around a pill and feed him off a spoon. You want to use the least amount of food possible so the patient will lick it up in one bit, never noticing the hidden pill. I have also tried other varieties that are very soupy and are to messy for babies or pets."
0,The fragrance of the tea totally blew me away. Recommend it to anyone who enjoys mild green tea with a pleasant rosey scent.
1,"Not too sweet, this very natural-flavored drink received an immediate ""Wow!"" from this taster, as it did with both my wife and 5-yr. old. (This latter can often deliver the death blow to food or beverage items adults deem worthy, so respect for this product was a definite plus!) Very refreshing, it seemed more like a professionally prepared light smoothie rather than a canned beverage. I wanted more!"
2,"I bought this flavor along with two others and was surprised at how different the texture was compared to Chick Chick and Super Salmon. It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes break the glass jars of other brands. I will just need to remember to pack some sandwich baggies in case it not working out when trying to eat it on the go."
0,"I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.  It's great at work and on the go, where you don't have time or equipment to brew loose leaf teas.  The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey."
0,"Really good quality tea.  Much superior to Twinings as tea.  The releasable plastic lined paper bag is much superior to the tins to keep excess air out.  This is important so the tea won't oxidize.  The tins look nice, but they hold too much air and don't reseal like a plastic zip seal."
1,This drink has a wonderful orange citrus flavor.  It is robust but not too strong.  A great natural alternative to soda.  My 13 year old likes it as well.  Would not hesitate to purchase.
4,"After finding out what horrors I'd been perpetrating on my kitties with their expensive ""premium"" pet food, I set out to find something that wasn't full of by-products and unnecessary corn ingredients. Halo Spot's Spew definitely fit that bill and their ingredients are probably the best you will find in a cat food. My cats, however, weren't as impressed as I was and turned their noses up at their new food. They did eat it, but clearly weren't enthused.<br />Although I like the human grade ingredients used in Halo foods, I do wish they used more meat sources. There are only a couple protein sources in the food and as a result the protein content of Spot's Stew, around 30%, is also a little lower than what I'd like.<br />Overall, however, this is definitely a great food to feed your pets, though if you have a cat that's a finicky eater or that needs a high protein food, Halo Spot's Stew may not be for you."
0,This is awesome tea and I purchased it as a gift for my aunt who loves this flavor. The price is what you'd expect to pay at Whole Foods or any other specialty store.
1,"My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me of nothing that I had every tasted before. I actually really liked the taste of it. Unlike your typical sodas, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz and I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and anyone within 20 or 30 yards of you is running for fresh air. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 135 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a really good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative, although this one tasted so good to me that I will definitely be purchasing this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's."
0,"I was looking for interesting tea to include in gift packages and nearly didn't order this because of a negative review.  I'm so glad I took the chance on this tea -- it's delicious, and extremely pretty in the tin, with the bits of orange and blue cornflower petals in the tea leaves.  Wonderfully fragrant, thanks to the orange.  Generally, I like gutsy, black, full-bodied tea, medium strong to strong, but I'm delighted with this refreshing change-of-pace.  It's not wimpy.  Am ordering more for Christmas gifts."
3,"This milk chocolate is made with the best ingredients. 6 ingredients. And they use all vanilla and cocoa butter and whole milk powder. Hershey uses vanillin...which is a wood extract..I have a bag that was given to me, and all I do is snack on it, letting it melt on my tongue to taste the almost orgasmic caramel flavor that stays with you for like ten minutes after eating it. Which ever chocolate you eat, let it melt on your tongue first instead of chomping on it. One, you eat less, and two, you appreciate it, and three, you can taste all the flavors."
4,"We do pet adoptions and also run a shelter for cats. I personally own 7 cats!!! I have absolutely never had a problem with feeding these to any of my cats.<br /><br />They have NEVER vommited from this treat, I have a hard time believing this!!<br /><br />I do know that the recommended amt of treats is only 10.. I have never fed more then 10-12 at a time!<br /><br />At home I have adopted a persian and I often use the hairball treatments with her and they actually DO WORK!!!!! I give her the suggested doce of 10 treats at a time and they are very tasty. Since, I have never seen her gag from hairballs, not once!<br /><br />All of my cats come running when I open these treats. My favorites are the vitamins as well as the hairball and the regular plain I also love to feed them. They love them all!<br /><br />The ONLY other treats I feed usually are Pounce and Party Mix but Temptations are there favortires!<br /><br />I HAVE ABOUT 8 BAGS OF THESE IN MY CABINETS... Because I have a lot of treats!<br /><br />At the shelter I run, we keep all kinds of cats and kittens and we have about 35 right now and NONE have never had any problems with these treats to date. I am sorry that others have maybe had problems but these are the most tastiest and healthy treats available. I also love that they provide GREAT dental care and tarter control.<br /><br />Providing these treats I honestly feel that my vet bills will be less in the future with also providing treats that they absolutely LOVE!!!!<br /><br />My mom and I pay the vet bills for any sick cats, we love cats!!! So far we have been blessed with wonderful healthy strays and none have been diagnosed with feline aids or Leukemia and we do vaccinate and have them tested.<br /><br />Please give these treats a try, they are awesome! Oh and also buy the large bags because it is actually saving you lots of money from buying the smaller bags.. You get about 3x the ammount!"
2,"We only use jarred baby food as emergency food.  I make all my little one's food and freeze it or give it fresh.  Yes, full time working mom but really is it that hard to cook, puree and freeze basic foods like carrots that cost $1.27 for 2 pounds?  I taste all the foods that my baby eats and enjoy the Earth's Best line because they taste real.  It's not food that you could add to a baby shower game and go ""what in the world was that?""  They use quinoa and kamut flours.  It is excellent all around.<br /><br />I believe that the apricot puree that other's talked about in the sweet potato and chicken dinner is there to maintain the color of the food.  I make my own sweet potato and chicken dinner for my little one and it turns brown.  My baby doesn't care about the color of the food but I'm sure maybe a mom would freak out if she saw this color in a baby food jar - knowing how vibrant sweet potatoes are.<br /><br />Half of the jars in my case were popped up.  I wrote amazon and at first they offered me not even the cost of the damaged jars.  I called and they replaced the entire case free of charge.  This had to have happened at the manufacturing plant and didn't occur during shipping but rather was a sealing issue.  I was impressed with the speed and efficiency at which amazon handled this.  Will continue to be a loyal customer because of this.  Customer service goes a long ways!"
2,"We started our son on solids when he was six months. The first ""food"" we introduced was rice cereal as recommended by our pediatrician. We tried every day for 2 weeks to feed my son rice cereal and then oatmeal cereal but he hated both! He'd refuse the food by turning away and keeping his mouth tightly shut. I was at my wits end and gave him a break because I knew I had to be patient. I was never a huge fan of the idea of feeding my son rice cereal so I went searching for something that was convenient and came in small portions. I didn't want to feed my son the traditional baby food from a jar due to the risk of BPA found in the jar lids. Luckily, I found NurturMe! My son loved it from the start.  We started with the peas and then worked our way through the apple, squash, and sweet potato.<br /><br />Here is what I love about NuturMe Baby Food:<br /><br />CONVENIENCE. The food comes in BPA-FREE paper pouches that are easy to travel with. They contain the same amount of food as a 2.5oz jar of baby food. When we first started my son on solids he ate 1/2 pouch at each feeding. We saved the rest in the fridge and fed the the rest at his second feeding. It states on the packaging that they can last 2-3 days refrigerated. I personally only trust 24 hours if prepared with formula and 2-3 days if made with water. This is because it states on the formula can that prepared formula should be discarded after 24 hours. If I still breastfed, I would trust breastmilk to last 2-3 days as well.<br /><br />TASTE. Although the food is quick dried, it tastes fresh! The peas actually taste like peas and they are actually bright green, like they should be. I've tried the foods myself before I first fed them to my son and they passed my taste test! I also love that the baby food is organic. This is very important to me that everything my son eats is free of pesticides. I am conscious about what I eat, it shouldn't be any different for my son.<br /><br />MIX & MATCH. I love that you can mix and match the baby foods together to make new flavor profiles for the baby. I am all about introducing new foods to my baby and this is the perfect way to do it! Another great idea is to add juice to the baby food once your baby is 8+ months. When my son gets older I am going to try out adding pomegranate juice to the apple variety. I don't plan of giving my son juice to drink so this is a great way to introduce him to the flavor of pomegranate.<br /><br />ECO-FRIENDLY. The packaging to completely recyclable and doesn't take of the space that canned baby food does. That means a smaller carbon footprint! In addition, the packaging is BPA-FREE. I emailed the company and asked them before I purchased the product on Amazon.<br /><br />Here is the only issue I have with NurturMe:<br /><br />CONSISTENCY. I noticed that it can be difficult to mix the baby food together to get the desired consistency. For instance, the apple was really clumpy and hard before I added the water and I had a difficult time getting all of the clumps out. Its similar to mixing formula -- you have to take extra care! My remedy for this was to use a handheld milk frother and from then on I got the perfect consistency with no clumps! I've also noticed that the peas have a little bit of a grainy texture but my son doesn't seem to mind.<br /><br />I am definitely happy with NuturMe baby food. I think it is a quick and convenient way to serve my baby organic baby food for when we are on the go! It is the best alternative I have found to homemade baby food."
3,This is a really great K-cup cocoa. I had been drinking the Cafe Express but they have really gone up lately so this is a good buy . Nice creamy chocolate flavor so I switched to this. I found it at Walmart but this price is better  here for the 3 pack. Give it a try :)
3,Love this stuff.  It has one of the best combinations of chocolate and mexican spice flavors of any I have tried.  I used to live near a bookstore where the cafe made mochas with this cocoa and now I buy it at home for the same purpose.  It also works really well to add a little spice to your cookies.
1,"I like this 'Kiwi Berry' more than the 'Watermelon Strawberry' I reviewed previously: it's less sweet, but still a little too sweet for me.  It advertises 'no sugar added' and '100% juice carbonated', so I was expecting somewhat sweet tasting, but not like this ~ it was too sweet, and packed 135 calories, 36g sugar and 34g carbs in a 'no sugar added'-'no corn syrup'- 'no preservatives'-'no artificial colors'-'gluten free' drink!  I would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry, but I would also expect it to TASTE natural, and this one (for all it's claims to the contrary) STILL did NOT taste very natural to me.<br /><br />It was certainly pleasant tasting, but for the tastebuds of someone who WAS a lifelong soda drinker (diet soda for the past 12 years), and gave up soda completely last May (I don't miss it at all!), this is not the drink for me.  I mostly drink water, milk, iced tea, hot tea & coffee now, and this sweet tasting, sugary tasting beverage, had way too much carbonation & flavoring for me!  The kiwi berry flavors were nice (much nicer than the watermelon strawberry), but still TASTED fake, which is weird for a drink that touts things like '100% juice' and a label that says 'natural flavors'...I would recommend this product only to those who like sweet, fruitie carbonated beverages, and aren't too worried about calories, etc."
1,"When I drank the strawberry kiwi, the flavor reminded me very much of the strawberry Pop Rocks candy. It was very sweet, but not so much that I felt like I needed to drink water after it. The carbonation was apparent, but not strong. Kinda like the carbonation in a Pellegrino, as opposed to a Coke. The can was a little on the small side, so I could see myself drinking 2 at once. I'd drink it again sometime, but it's not an everyday buy."
2,I usually buy avoderm but this food is an excellent way for me to stretch out the case. I feed the kids this and they eat it all.... No leftovers!
1,"I was pleased to discover that Switch Orange Tangerine is actually quite tasty.  More please to find out that it contains no sugar, corn syrup or artificial flavors.  What it does have is several healthy ingredients.  I highly recommend it."
2,I purchased this food on Amazon then saw it at Babies R Us for 30 cents less per jar.  I like the product but AMAZON is overcharging!
1,"I didn't care for Kiwi Berry Switch. It was very sweet and not refreshing at all. Also, at 135 calories in an 8.3 ounce can, it actually contains a lot more calories than regular soda. I know it is all natural and doesn't have HFC (High Fructose Corn Syrup), and I appreciate that, but it also doesn't have much actual kiwi or berry juices. The drink is VERY sweet, but sweeter than 100% fruit juice, sweeter even than your average can of soda. I can't say I would ever buy this product or recommend it to anyone else. There are better natural sodas on the market, as well as better 100% natural juices."
3,"I liked the milk chocolate version, so tried this.  It is just as good, and with the more intense chocolate flavor, appeals to my chocolate desires."
3,My mom and son love the flavor of this hot chocolate. Add a little bit of milk afterwards and 1 splenda and the taste is amazing.
0,"At my local market, they sell this fragrant, nutty, excellent tea for $1.99 a box! $4.99 a box is highway robbery! Shop around!"
3,I am amazed how well these little cups taste.  These Kcups taste very well.  This hot chocolate taste great and are ready in one minute.
0,This tea smells and tastes like Christmas! This has always been my family's favorite tea for children's (and big kid's) tea parties.
2,These pouches are so easy and convenient. They taste great and are perfect for busy moms.
1,"This drink is refreshing, but a little too sweet for me. I found that others in my household enjoyed it more than I did, so it might be more fair to give it a four star."
3,I love this hot chocolate  !  this is just a great drink -- the first couple times I made it I didn't do it correctly and it didn't so good --  You have to nuke the bar of chocolate for 30 seconds in microwave  - and you have to put in blender -- so all ingredients blend  -- if you don't you will have a chalky and that would be sad  --  what I have learned is  put chocolate in microwave --  put your milk in sauce pan and warm it up  -- add chocolate and stir  --  when the chocolate melts put into a blender or I use immersion blender to get all spices blended  --  yeah and then you have the best hot chocolate in the world --  how can you go wrong with big beautiful piece of chocolate ?  all other hot chocolate drinks are kind of boring compared to this  --
0,"If you are a chamomile tea drinker, you will be happy to discover this tea.  The citrus addition makes for a full-bodied but smooth tea.  Definitely the best chamomile tea on the market.  Also, I brew one bag in a coffee maker dedicated to tea only, and get a whole pot out of each bag.  You won't be disappointed in this one."
1,"This product is carbonated and 100% fruit juice with NO high fructose corn syrup. It has packs 140 calories in a little over 8 oz. of product.<br />I prefer my drinks with 0 calories or just plain water.<br /><br />The taste wasn't pleasing to me and it left an unpleasant aftertaste. Also, the sweetness of the drink made it less than a thirst quencher."
0,"I am not sure how to review tea, I don't know the vocabulary and I'm no expert but I have long been a fan of the Genmai Cha after marrying into a Japanese family. I prefer the loose product over the bags but for convenience I choose to try to the bags, I'm happy with it. If you are careful to not boil the water or let the tea steep too long it will not disappoint you."
1,"I absolutely Love this drink. This is the best carbonated fruit drink I have ever tasted. This has a crisp, clean taste of fresh strawberry with just a hint of kiwi. This tastes just as you would expect a pure fruit juice to taste, except without the pulp and a carbonation that makes it fun for both kids and adults alike. I found a new fruit juice that I love and I'm making the switch to ""Switch."""
1,"...and you'll have a pretty good idea what this tastes like. The tangerine (and/or the added flavoring) provides a nice 'tang' to the flavor. I found it to be quite tasty and refreshing.  I'm not sure why they are packaging it in the small 8.3 oz ""energy drink""-size cans, unless it's to keep the calories per serving down. At 140 cal.can, it certainly isn't low-cal, but there is no added HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) or sugar. The surprisingly high price is also a downside. True, real juice is a lot more expensive than water and HFCS, but at this price, I'll give it a pass.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good taste, not too carbonated<br /><br />Cons:<br />Small can, expensive, fairly high calorie/oz"
1,As the title of my review indicates this product is nothing special in terms of taste. Granted it is missing some of the soda pop bad guys (high fructose syrup and coloring)but the taste is mediocre. This is not something you are going to rave about because of the taste. If you are a health food junkie you might overlook the bland middle of the road taste. Contrary to some reviews I did not find the drink exceptionally sweet but than again everyone has different taste buds. I am not a soda pop drinker so that might have some influence on my less than enthusiastic endorsement. I was switched off. Will this make you give up your favorite soda pop? Probably not. I like the idea of homemade soda water infused juice for that perky fizzing drink better than Switch. Not such a great product in my opinion.
0,"Once again I find myself trying to like Tazo herbal teas, but they keep putting licorice in teas where is just doesn't seem to belong, to me anyway.  This is another example where I expected a lovely flavored tea and the licorice flavor is so strong, it's just about all I can taste.  I guess I'll just give up on Tazo - who ever blends all their teas has radically different taste buds than mine!"
0,"I normally like Assam teas, but this is pretty bland -- the flavor is simple & shallow.  There's no richness, earthiness or depth.  Considering that this a pound bag of the stuff, if you buy it there'll be a lot of boring tea to slog through (or throw out).<br /><br />One reviewer commented about the paper package impairing retention of flavor.  FWIW, while the outer bag is paper, it's plastic-coated on the inside; it may not be a hermetic seal, but it's adequate.  Based on my experience, if you're spooning single servings, you can probably expect the wire fold-closure to break halfway through the bag, so have a clothespin around."
2,"My kids love these!  They have a great flavor and, for us, are preferred over Sharkies.  My daughter sometimes gets stomach aches from fruit snacks, but has had no trouble with these."
3,"This is a great treat for the Fall and Winter months hunting, camping or just snuggling up to watch a movie. The cinnamon is not too overpowering with the chocolate and has a rich cocoa flavor. My wife drinks it as an alternative to coffee so she can sleep at night."
0,"This is not your typical ""loose leaf"" grocery market tea. It is whole leaf, pure, aromatic Earl Grey tea. It is very bold tasting, if you are not an Earl Grey fan, don't get it, but if you are, buy two. Excellent!"
4,"I think 9 Lives does a better job on this variety than Friskies.  Or I should say my cat does.  Friskies doesn't look as fresh or as appetizing as 9 Lives, and my cat doesn't like it as well.  It just smells nasty and looks not quite as good as the 9 Lives.  I think they could definitely do better on this variety -maybe even add cheese to it!  My cat leaves this one in the dish but eats the 9 Lives version."
1,"Switch has been the first ""soda alternative"" that I've LOVED! It's got a delightful fresh fruit flavor, refreshing bubbles, and no aftertaste. It is sweet and juicy tasting, reminds me a little of Orange Crush. The tangerine flavor adds just the right note to peak your interest and overcome becoming just another orange drink. However, the price point of just at $1 a can prevents me from keeping it stocked in our home. Still, I would recommend it for an occasional treat."
0,I used this in a gift basket for a ladies tea. I like the product myself. Very nicely packaged. Thank you.
0,I've used this tea for years off and on. It taste great for a detox type tea and I like to use it when I'm on a fast for a few days to help clean my body out. It's one of the few things I allow myself to drink while fasting.
3,"I've tried them all and keep coming back to the Belgian chocolate.  A chocoholic's dream. I drink this every morning and this seem's to be the most economical way to buy it, 6 cans at a time."
2,"I bought these for my vegan father who LOVES the curry kale chips by Rhythm Superfoods (my 22 month old daughter, husband and I also like them)!<br /><br />Thought I would give him a new kale chip flavor--BBQ--as part of his Christmas gift. Although a different brand than we typically eat, they sounded good. First, I was disappointed to see these chips are not kale in its natural curly form but pressed into round, dog-snack-looking discs. Luckily I tried them before giving them. I spit it right out! Was it just me? My husband also tried one and couldn't finish even one chip.<br /><br />I have a pack of 4 that cannot be returned... what a waste of food and money!"
2,My baby loves these dinners. They are very flavorful and not bland like other baby food that we have tried. I love the fact that they are organic and Amazon sells them at such a great price.
4,"I open a can of this stuff, and it looks like real food.  I spoon it onto the dishes for my four, and it dishes like actual meat and sauce.  All four of them dive right into it, and all four saucers are licked clean.<br /><br />I have seen the health benefits to my cats from feeding them high quality grain-free food.  This Turducken canned food is one of the staples of their diet.  I love feeding it to them, and they love eating it.<br /><br />In my view, it's worth the extra money to get really good food for one's pets."
3,"I love a cup of Hot Choc. in the cold winter months. We live in Penna. and it gets quite chilly here. The Hot Coc. is a little sweet for my taste, but I've gotten used to it and enjoy a cup once in a while"
3,This is the best cocoa ever. It beats out anything you can buy in the store.  Sometimes<br />I just mix it in my coffee and it's wonderful.  Highly recommend.
2,I'm sure this Mama Grain is pretty healthy but it taste disgusting. Even my daughter who is not a picky eater refuse to eat this. The combination of sweet banana and beans doesn't go well at all.
3,"Totally not worth paying for. Even my kids hated this stuff. Very cheap cocoa in tiny tiny tins for too much money. I could have gone out and bought twice as much Swiss Miss, and enjoyed that a whole lot more."
1,"This tastes very similar to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and seems to be identical except for a touch of Kiwi and Strawberry juice.  Its got 135 calories so is not a diet drink.  It's really sweet and would go well as a drink mixer like the watermelon strawberry variety.<br /><br />It's got light carbonation, 100% of the USRDA of vitamin C and costs about $1.00 a can.  Personally, I'll stick to plain old tap water because this is really just extra calories and not worth $1.00 a can.  It is a nice fruity sweet drink that many might like to go along with lunch."
1,"I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I'd original expected. (A common problem in some fruit wines.)<br /><br />This is, indeed, good strawberry flavor!  Just add to your sugary concoction (be it a baking good, a dessert or a drink) to either give strawberry flavor (or add to existing flavor), and presto, just about everyone will be licking their lips (and maybe fingers).<br /><br />For those interested, I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid."
0,"I've used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious, consistently good quality black tea. Mainly I use it and several other Numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha."
2,"This is the perfect finger food.  I usually eat a handful at a time.  Though to be honest, when asked how they taste, I say, ""It varies from person to person."""
0,"This tea has a superb taste.  I actually look forward to drinking this tea with my dinner.  Now that it is summer I drink is as an iced tea, but this is also a very delicious hot drink too!  I use splenda and fresh mint when I brew it.  Fabulous!"
1,"Yes, you should buy these excellent fruit drinks because they taste G-RRRRREAT! (As long as price is not an object)<br />Tastes just like kiwi's and strawberries mixed in with carbonated water.<br />But the can says... 100% juice!"
0,"This variety pack of Twinings tea has four flavors.  The Lady Grey is my favorite, hands down. It makes delicious iced tea.  It has a crisp, clean taste.  The other three flavors are good also.<br /><br />I use only two bags to make a pitcher of iced tea and it's strong enough with just the two bags.  This tea can be found locally, but costs much more than the Amazon price.  This is my second purchase of this item."
0,"Fewer and fewer stores carry loose-leaf tea and I was so glad to find it on Amazon. Who knew?  I've become an avid fan of Amazon over the last few months.  It's wonderful to have someone ELSE do the ""shopping"" for me and allows me to find products in one place."
2,"My son Loves these ""fruit bars"" they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars.  My suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones... Now my son favors them (chocolate) ones MORE than the berry ones..."
1,"While the sugar count is slightly higher than a can of coca-cola, this soda gets it sugar from 100% Fruit Juice, not from High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I wouldn't give this to my daughter every day but as an alternative to soda once in awhile I think it is a good choice!  Plus it tastes great!"
2,Convenient packaging and the babies love it.  They just gobble it right up.<br /><br />This flavour is the best one out of the HappyBaby line of pouch foods.  The worst I would have to say is the Amaranth Ratatouille.  Chick Chick has a nice subtle flavour and nice texture.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
1,"My Experience:<br /><br />It's very translucent, with just a light golden color. It smells like you'd expect a peach to smell, but the taste hints of a white grape juice, though it has no grape in it and tastes more peachy over time, especially as it warms up. It's tingly on the tongue, but doesn't foam up. It's slightly drier than your average juice, with a hint of bitterness, probably from the carbonation.<br /><br />Did I Like it: Yes, though not as much as their offering in Pomegranate-Apple, a 6 out of 10. My wife doesn't like it so much."
1,"I also reviewed the Jones Soda Berry Pomegranate vitamin water and that one fell short because it was mostly water and sugar and cost over $1 per bottle.<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine is much better in my opinion in terms of flavor. It's also carbonated up quite a bit and has added ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) which gives it a lot of tang/bite. For me it isn't unpleasant at all - I like it.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviews, I don't get the medicine aftertaste. It's just a good, refreshing, carbonated drink. I tried this after getting in from a fairly warm bike ride and it does a pretty good job of quenching thirst. I tried it straight from a room temperature can and over ice and both were great. I like it over ice better, though. Then, just for fun, I added some Malibu rum to see how it was as a mixer and it's not bad. I won't be asking for it at a bar, but it gets the fruity flavor with the coconut rum and I think if someone was creative, this could be a match made in heaven.<br /><br />The down side (to me) is this is another fairly pricey drink. The cans aren't full-size cans either. So for almost $1 per can you get a smallish 8.3 ounces but with regular sodas you get 12 ounces - half again as much. Of course, sodas aren't 100% juice either.<br /><br />Upshot is if I'm on a beach somewhere and hot and thirsty, I'd probably buy this. For stocking at home, I'll stick with regular frozen orange juice or orange juice in a carton. I would recommend trying it for yourself, though. This seems to be one of those drinks that could sway pretty hard depending on personal preferences."
0,tea has excellent flavor. it is a little expensive but very convenient and great when you don't want to wait for the kettle.
1,"The Switch Orange/Tangerine gets kudos from me for not including added sugars and nasty ingredients found in some traditional sodas, but as for flavor, it leaves something to be desired.  The initial yummy tangerine flavor of the drink is great, but after a few swallows, a strange after-taste invaded my mouth.  I found it difficult to drink the whole can."
1,"Switched Kiwi Berry is fairly good soft drink; strongly berry-flavored with a light hint of kiwi. Nutritionally, the drink contains more sugar and calories than an equivalent 8 oz serving of soda or iced tea, but these seem in-line with other juice beverages. This drink makes me curious why Snapple didn't branch into carbonated fruit beverages, but perhaps the reason may have something to do with cost. It is difficult to select this beverage when it costs two to three times more than soda or canned iced tea; however, I would buy a case of mixed flavors, if such an SKU became available, for entertaining purposes."
3,"This is actually better than I expected when I paid less than 50 cents each.  We usually use a packet mix and hot water from the brewer.  This is much easier and the taste is comparable.  If you are very particular you may not like this but for something quick, sweet, chocolate flavored and warm for around 50 cents it is worth a try.  I would not buy it at the regular price that some retailers ask."
3,"there is a taste of sugar substitute, the aftertaste turns me off, I've even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. It didn't, so i'm just using Swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig."
1,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:47 Mins<br /><br /></span>Short video review with first open, pour and taste of The Switch Orange Tangerine."
1,"Last year I tasted several of the Izze fruit drinks for the first time and became addicted.  I have an affinity for fruity foods and beverages, and that fact combined with my positive experiences with Izze prompted me to try THE SWITCH.<br /><br />I'll say it right off the bat - THE SWITCH was okay, but it doesn't really compare in taste to Izze.  If I had never tasted Izze, I might enjoy THE SWITCH more.  As it is, I thought it was tasty enough, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to get it.  If I were in the convenience store looking for a refreshing fruity beverage, I might buy it again.<br /><br />I tried two different flavors of THE SWITCH, and the Kiwi Berry was my least favorite of the two flavors (the other was Black Cherry).  The kiwi berry flavor was nice, but a little bit muddled for me.  However, the fruit flavors did taste natural - I just think I would have preferred a simple Kiwi flavor instead of the blend.<br /><br />To sum up, I think THE SWITCH is a nice alternative to sodas, although a little pricier than colas are.  It is a refreshing fruit beverage, but there are other brands that have a tastier flavor.<br /><br />If Amazon allowed half-star ratings, I would give this 3.5 stars."
3,"I could do without the cocoa in the batter because it makes them look burned when they are not, but very tasty."
0,"Expensive, but worth it, and Ive tried every Iced tea out there. Lipton is pretty good too, but this is the best!! Tetleys sux, and many other Iced teas like Bigelow are terrible, but this is great! Like the coffee shop"
1,"I thought it would have a clean, crisp taste, but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda I've ever had.  Maybe that's deliberate; maybe they're targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda, unless presented with a more ""natural"" alternative...  Regardless, it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates, with some orange coloring thrown into the mix, i.e., nothing special."
0,"I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea."
0,"I would recommend this tea, it has a fresh taste with an amazing acai grape flavor that I have not had before.  It also gave me energy which I can always use!"
1,"The first sip gave a pleasing kiwi flavor burst with a light tang of carbonation.  When testing the black cherry flavor, I had placed the can in the freezer for a short period, since I prefer drinks to be ice cold or hot; I didn't want lukewarm to get in the way of a positive response to the first sip.  As the drink warmed a bit, the sweetness overtook the carbonation, which is inevitable in a carbonated beverage, yet, due to the purity of the fruit base, the flavor remained true and welcome.<br /><br />This time, I just had the drink chilled perfectly for me, no ice crystals.  I like the kiwi even better than the cherry!  The kiwi has more tang.  See below (or on the product description on the buying page) for the juice blends used.  I've noticed that most juices currently have apple and grape included, likely because those are cheaper to produce.<br /><br />The way the drink was promoted wasn't a lie!  It worked for me:<br /><br />1. ""100 % of what you want.  0% of what you don't want.""<br /><br />2. ""Make The Switch to a great tasting, all natural beverage that's the perfect balance between JUICE and CARBONATION.""<br /><br />3. The logo has ""THE"" placed upside-down and reversed, atop ""Switch,"" with a swirl designed around the words, the swirl imitating the symbol for reversing something.<br /><br />4. The ingredients read: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola* [I added the asterisk; see below] and raspberry and strawberry juice concentrated), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)""<br /><br />5. 100% juice carbonated.<br /><br />6. The can is smaller than the norm for soda pops, which I also liked, because when I used to drink sodas regularly, I usually opened a can and left half of it to get too warm (and fizzed out), so the remainder went down the drain (after I returned it to the fridge for a few days hoping I might drink it).  I drank the whole can of Black Cherry!<br /><br />I decided I liked the near slush state of a short stint in the freezer... leaving it too long, though, might cause too much separation of the fruit concentrate from the fizz water... and, of course, makes it undrinkable from the can until it melts enough to flow through the hole in the top.<br /><br />In the past, when I had begun wanting something more natural than most soda beverages (with phosphates, etc., added), I had used frozen orange juice concentrate added to Club Soda or Ginger ale.  It didn't take long to feel that the process was too much trouble (and it was more expensive than the cost of the Switch product).  Also, I like the types of fruits Switch is using.<br /><br />At first I was confused at the acerola* ingredient, not knowing what it was.  Since my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154JDAI"">Kindle 2: Amazon's New Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a> was at hand, as always, I looked up acerola in the onboard dictionary.  The word wasn't in there, so I pushed the curser to the right, on the arrow for more types of searches, and used my standby, Google, and found several listings of acerola.<br /><br />Briefly, I found that it's thought to have originated from the Yucatan, and is known as Barbados cherry or wild crape myrtle, a tropical fruit-bearing shrub.  Reading into the variety of praiseworthy qualities of that cherry, I was impressed!  It has 32 times the amount of vitamin C as Orange juice, and many other healthful assets.  If you're interested in details, feel free to go Google.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that many of the flavors available from Switch will include equally intriguing tropical fruits.  (I was glad to see that the Kiwi flavor also has acerola in it).<br /><br />Though the can is appealing and fine, this beverage is good enough to deserve a designer bottle to appeal to the gourmet crowd who want flavor without true health issues... don't get me started on the myriad of heavy promotions of pseudo health issues.  I have a book in progress to be published on KINDLE, which will debut with steam hissing out of Kindle's ears, at no extra charge!  (I'll add a comment to this review about why I had quit drinking soda pops, which will explain why I will be happily able to welcome Switch into my diet.)<br /><br />My thanks to THE SWITCH for providing a healthy, gourmet quality drink... WITHOUT, thank God, SOYBEANS added!!<br /><br />I'm hooked!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several Kindle books and Amazon Shorts"
3,"I tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before I bought it, but couldn't find anything online. Turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists, and yet, that didn't help the taste at all. It is awful.<br /><br />I had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldn't find any takers. I finally got rid it of it at the Christmas White Elephant gift exchange at work. I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste. It takes about three minutes, and it's delicious. Now, where did I put those mini-marshmallows?"
4,I should bite the bullet and only order this more expensive Fancy Feast for my 3 cats. They all love it; it's the sauce. There isn't any waste. Setting up autoship assures me that I am getting the best possible price around.
0,"This is my very favorite tea of all. I drink it year-round and never get tired of it like I do of others. It's good any time of the day. Not too strong, but still nicely flavorful, with a good balance of minty/spicy/herbal-y."
1,"Ingredients: carbonated wated, cane sugar, caramel color, caffeine, Brazilian guarana, sodium benzoate, citric acid, natural and artificial flavors, red # 40.<br /><br />If you can get past the skull and swords on the label, this root beer will go down nicely. You will get a buzz out of the caffeine and guarana in the brew, so it's a good substitute for your morning coffee. Plus: it's made with nice cane sugar, not nasty corn syrup. One caveat, sodium benzoate is used ""to preserve freshness"" on this and many soft drinks; I read that it should not be taken with citrus. Enjoy!"
3,Both my friend and I love this product. The dark chocolate and the mint really supplement each other. A little expensive but excellent quality.
0,"Love it, love it, love it!  Both me and my 10 year old drink this herbal tea quite often.  Very tasty!"
3,"I was introduced to this product a few years ago and was floored by how tasty and depending on the amount and type of milk added (2% or whole), how chocolaty the flavor could even be.  I've recently moved and don't know where to find it locally so I'm trying the online purchasing option - I'm almost out of it!<br /><br />This is a very nice option for those of us who don't drink coffee all that often but want to have something of quality in the kitchen cupboard.  Goes great with Trader Joes hot chocolate powder too"
0,"Earl grey is definitely one of my favorite flavors, however I had to knock a couple stars off the Twinnings brand (sorry - their other products tend to be the best!) as I find the Bergamot flavor to be too strong.  It borders on fruit/perfume.  Those who like the Bergamot flavor to overtake the tea flavor may rate this a full five stars, however for me it was too much like candy (I compare it to the way grape candy would come through your nose) and not enough like tea.  I find the celestial seasonings version of this tea (in decaf) to be flawless."
1,"I love Sky Blue sodas. And when I saw the Creamy Root Beer, as someone who loves all root beer, I ordered a case. Got it today, chilled a six pack for a few hours. Then poured one in a glass. Tasted it. Almost vomited. And then proceeded to dump them all down the drain. Horrible, horrible taste. I don't get how this can taste so bad, and all the others are so so good."
2,"This should be called Sad Baby--it's awful. My baby absolutely hates it! I tasted a tiny bit<br />and it was bland to the point of gagging. Besides I assumed (wrongly obviously) that Stage 3<br />food--for babies 7+ months--would have some chunks of real food. Unfortunately, it's just glop,<br />and unfortunately, incredibly tasteless glop. I tried other flavors from this brand and they<br />were just as disgusting, my baby wont eat any of the flavors at all."
3,These were a little disappointing. The hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange...kind of plastic tasting. Haven't been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig
0,"These were great - just as described. Used them for a bee-themed party, and now we use them as ""to go"" packs of honey for our coffee and tea."
3,"I mainly use my Keurig for coffee but thought I'd try this one since I love dark chocolate and it was getting mostly good reviews.  I've tried some other chocolate K-cups and had given up on them since they all seemed pretty watery.  If I can taste water I don't consider it real hot chocolate.  I was pleasantly surprised that this tastes much better than the others I've tried.  (I must admit there are many I haven't tried, but I don't really feel like making a big scientific study of it.)  This will be my source of hot chocolate from now on.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to see how many ingredients it contains.  That sort of thing worries me a little.  Still, I don't drink hot chocolate that much, so I think I'll survive.  I'll copy the ingredient label here for those concerned plus a few items from the nutrition info:<br /><br />Calories 60, from fat 20.  Trans Fat 0g. Sodium 200mg. Sugars 6g.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: sugar, glucose syrup solids, cocoa (processed with alkali), partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (may contain coconut, soybean, sunflower, palm and/or canola), modified whey, maltodextrin, salt, natural and artificial flavors, cellulose gum, sodium caseinate, cornstarch, lactose, dipotassium phosphate, sucralose, mono- and diglycerides, silicon dioxide, soy lecithin, artificial color. [Contains milk and soy.]<br /><br />(I always hate seeing artificial coloring in ""dark"" chocolate products.)<br /><br />If I had hot chocolate every day I would consider making it from scratch with more cocoa and fewer chemicals, but since I enjoy the convenience of having it nearly instantly from my Keurig on the occasional whim, I'll just keep a box of these K-cups on hand.  I highly recommend it for the taste, it isn't easy finding good hot chocolate."
0,This is an excellent tea - subtle pear taste in an exquisite white tea blend
0,"I am disappointed in the quality of this and of the Darjeeling loose teas. Years ago when I used Twinings regularly, it was of a higher quality. Then I switched to Murchie's of Canada,excellent quality teas, and now I tried Twinings again and am disappointed with it. It is acceptable, but not what I like in my teas."
1,This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.<br />I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.<br />I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.
1,"Recently I had the pleasure of trying the Kiwi Berry flavor of Switch 100% fruit juice. It is unbelievable that a sugarless carbonated drink can taste so great and yet be good for you. The Kiwi Berry was bold and tangy instead of sweet and cloying. The carbonation made the drink sparkling and energetic. Since I have recently kicked my 15 year habit of drinking Diet Coke, I have been looking for a substitute drink that wasn't straight fruit juice or straight soda. As an American I have become accustomed to thinking that carbonated drinks are the fun ones and that merely being healthy by drinking juice is boring. So Switch allows me to feel healthy and have some fun at  the same time while also giving up caffeine which I really don't want during the day. If Switch comes out with additional flavors I will certainly try those as well."
3,"I've been through two 24 cup boxes of this hot chocolate, and it isn't great.  It's not badly priced, and the first few sips are fine.  But after it sits for five minutes cooling in your cup it separates.  It ends up being watery for the most part with a bunch of chocolate mix on the bottom."
3,"Grove square Hot Cocoa is just the right amout of milk chocolate, not to much chocolate, just the right mixture. Delicious! I say a good cup of hot chocolate. Try Grove Square Hot Cocoa, Milk Chocolate K cups for Keurig Coffee Makers. Enjoy! I did."
0,This is very good tea in an elegant sachet. A little pricier than some but produces a wonderful flavor whether you're drinking it hot or cold.
4,"This one seems to be flavored more to a cat's liking than the rest of the Florentine varieties.  They're expensive, so buy one of each to see what floats with your cat but here, one will eat this and the other one won't.  It is gobbled up quite quickly too, I might add, by one of them so there you go!  Anyway, the greens addition is great for cats, they seem to like it in their other varieties, and they're high on the nutrition scale. So, if you're looking for higher protein and better nutrition all around, be sure to give these a go.  In our house, the pates have fared the best over the shreds and particularly, these florentines.  The egg soufles seem to be the favorites here - they ""hoover"" them down so fast they barely come up for air!  Recommend!"
0,"This is a wonderful deep-flavored classic Assam tea, and certified organic, as well. The flavor is malty and rich, with no bitterness or off-flavors. Stands up well to milk and a bit of sugar but would also be excellent without them, say, as an iced tea in summer. I am a simple tea drinker, not a gourmet expert. I simply like this tea a lot and will purchase it again."
3,"The first time I tasted this Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate was in a restaurant in Southern Colorado. It was a cool rainy day and I was in love with it after the first sip.I have never tasted anything this good. I took down the name of the product, googled it, and quickly ordered it from Amazon. I will now be ready for the first snowy day in Denver. It is the best hot chocolate mix ever!!!"
3,"I only rated this item as a 4 star because it is not Dark Chocolate as the label says. It's more like a darker Milk Chocolate. I happen to love ""Dark"" Chocolate.<br /><br />This bar gets the 4 because since I am a recovering sugar addict it is just right for me today because I am being good. I don't think I will purchase this item again because it is not Dark Chocolate, which is what I love.  I will go back to the SunSpire Dark Chocolate Coconut bars because I don't want to feel deprived and their bars are truly Dark Chocolate and Coconut!!!!  I have cut out over 90% of sugar in my diet and I these bars will be my reward.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006K02VJC"">Oskri Coconut Bar, Original with Dark Chocolate, 1.9-Ounce (Pack of 20)</a><br />In spots the covering has a whitish look. I don't know whether that is because it traveled across California during a heat wave or because the bars are old. The company needs to adjust/edit their label to be accurate.<br /><br />10:50p.m.<br />Update - I have decided to return this product for a refund. Oskri charges more for Dark Chocolate than for their regular Coconut Bar. I did not feel it was right for them to charge extra for Dark Chocolate when that is not what they deliver. They may not even have a Dark Chocolate Bar, judging by what they shipped to me. It is Milk Chocolate. Anyone who sees these bars will immediately know they are Milk and not Dark Chocolate.<br /><br />I am very disappointed since I no longer eat Milk Chocolate. I am totally addicted to Dark Chocolate.<br /><br />Update 4/25/2012<br />I was wrong about the Chocolate. I opened a second bar and it was Dark Chocolate. I believe some of the bars were melted during the time the package traveled across California during a heat wave. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone loving coconut and Dark chocolate."
1,"We think the Kiwi-Berry flavor is not overly sweet like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> although it is still just a hair sweeter than we would have liked.<br /><br />However, when compared to traditional sodas and colas, this is a healthier and tastier alternative, as this is made of various juice concentrates and carbonated water, without sugar and corn syrup.<br /><br />Having said that though, this 8.3oz can packs 135 calories, most of them coming from the fruit sugars of course. Another plus is that one serving (the whole can) has 100% RDA of Vitamin C.<br /><br />We also give them bonus points for encouraging recycling of this can and putting that notice in a rather visible spot using the same font as the rest of their text - instead of fine-printing it."
1,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40"">The Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>When you grave carbonated beverages,such as soda, but do not want the bad parts of soda.  This drink is for you.  The flavor is light and fruit, but not sweet.  The drink is a healthy choice, it contains vitamin C, no caffeine, and is refreshing.  My 7 year old daughter loved it, and she is extremely fussy. If you are trying to stop drinking soda, this is the drink for you."
3,"Grove Square Hot Chocolate is the best K-cup hot chocolate. I read many reviews before making this purchase, and now I agree, and will continue to buy this brand."
1,"This is a refreshing, tasty, sweet drink, and a nice change from soda.<br />The strawberry/kiwi mix has great taste, and would be terrific on a hot day. I was surprised by the intensity of the flavor, and did not expect the sweetness.<br />My personal preference, though, is for non-carbonated drinks, and I would have preferred it without carbonation.<br />It is also quite high in calories at 135 calories for 8.3 ounces, which is fairly hefty.<br />I believe that this is a healthier, better tasting summer drink, which has a much more natural and fresher taste than colas do, and I believe that most people will really love it."
1,"This drink is fizzy, sweet, and delicious!  I was so pleasantly surprised by it.  It really does taste like you're drinking something so yummy that it must be bad for you.  How fun that it's not!  I loved the Kiwi Berry flavor, and definitely recommend anyone trying to kick the habit of unhealthy sodas to give this a shot."
4,"Too much of a good thing? We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. By this time, the cats couldn't keep it in or down. What a mess. We've moved on."
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry was a good drink. I thought it was a little too sweet for my taste, but not by much. One serving size was 8.3 fluid ounces. It contains 33 grams of sugar and 34 grams of carbs per serving, and each serving was 135 calories. According to the label, it contains 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C. The drink has a slight carbonation to it that was a lot less than soda. The small and skinny can makes it good for inclusion in a lunch box.<br /><br />Although I liked it, I don't think it's worth the price of nearly $1 a can. But for the convenience of size, it might be worth the trade-off on occasion."
4,"I've been feeding Wellness grain-free for a while now and all three of them love it. I ordered the Felidae last time because the Wellness was no longer eligible for free shipping and the Felidae was - which makes the difference between whether it is a better deal to order it or buy it at Petco brick and mortar....None of my cats will eat it. They actually at NOTHING for the past 2 days since the only thing offered them was the Felidae. I broke down today and gave them a back-up can of 9-Lives grain free and they are happily curled up and purring now. I think Felidae is a high quality food and I only feed the lower quality grain-free food on rare occasion, but the rest of this case will be donated to my local shelter. Hopefully, something there will like it. I'm off for the trip to Petco for the Wellness."
0,"This tea is the best tea i've ever had. i first tasted it in norway, and had to find it in the states. i have it every morning."
1,So how does it taste? Well depends on how sweet you like your drinks. It is tasty but it's not as the container would leave you to believe that it is good for you. This is no better then drinking a soda filled with corn syrup because of the amount of calories and carbs it contains. It's all sugar and it shows not only going in but around the mid section if you pounded these things for a few months straight.<br /><br />Pass.
4,"we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies."
0,This tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this tea-drinking household. We love it and it really starts the morning off right. Perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites?? The taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day.
3,"Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla<br />""cocoa.""  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe<br />what you read, right?<br />I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~"
0,"This is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea.  Sometimes convenience outweighs taste, but not always.  What this product doesn't tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are: black tea with tea extract, hibiscus and citric acid.  It's not just tea.  And it doesn't taste like just tea, either.  It tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar.  It has an overtaste of lemon -- that's probably the citric acid.  And that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix.  I'll probably drink it when it's really convenient.  But I won't serve it to friends!  And I won't drink it if I have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice."
0,"I see there are no other reviews for this item yet. There need to be! It is great, and with recent changes in Twinings lineup, I'm sure more people like me are out there looking for a good replacement-- so I hope this will be helpful to some who are doing as I have done. I took a blind chance on this tea-- and I am so glad I did. I've been a fan of black currant iced tea ever since I first tried it. For years I used Twinings brand, but they have changed their formula and I have read many negative reviews, so I decided to look for a new brand. I tried several others and Mighty Leaf black currant has been the best so far.  If you are a fan of Twinings Black currant (the original) and/or you like the black currant iced teas served by Jason's Deli or Corner Bakery, you will probably really like this tea as it has a very similar taste. It is slightly stronger and has a little more of a ""bite"" than Twinings version did, (which I like)  and it is an excellent quality tea all around. There are several brands out there whose interpretation of what black currant tea tastes like is very far removed from this flavor I am familiar with. A few of them I tried were just downright weird. I am not really sure which black currant taste is more ""authentic"" to be honest, I just know what I like and I am very very happy with this tea. I will be buying this brand from now on for making my iced tea. It is well worth having to order it."
2,This baby food is both convenient and healthy. it's great to not worry about what my son is eating and be able to grab this when I'm in a pinch!
0,"This is great sencha tea with just a hint of orange.  Being whole leaves rather than just the fines really makes a flavor difference - almost as good as brewing from bulk leaves and certainly more convenient.  It's too bad it's packaged in what appear to be nylon bags, however.  They do not seem to be readily decomposable - not a good thing since we try to compost and recycle everything we can."
0,"The price on this product was just right.  After searching (and failing) to find ANY loose Gunpowder Green Tea at any of my local grocery stores, I resorted to Amazon, and Twinings came through.  The tea is very fresh and comes separately packaged in 6 tins.  Although I personally would prefer a larger single tin (I'm already through tin 1 of the set), this does ensure freshness for the rest of the tea."
2,"I've been buying these for nearly 5 years and this is the fiirst time that my son has refused to eat them. They are darker green than usual, which was not a problem, but the texture was chewier and the flavor wasn't as good. This is a problem since it's the only vegetable my son eats and he has severe feeding issues. The taste & texture were so different he was gagging. Not pleased with the change."
2,"The beef, chicken, and turkey and gravy foods are disgusting. They are so disgusting, I didn't have the heart to feed this to my child. When I popped the lid to these the first thing I noticed was the foul smell. It made me gag. I can't even describe how bad this smelled. It was like rotten meat flavored jello. I didn't have the heart to make my daughters eat it so I gave it to my cats. None of them would go near it except for one who ate about 1/4 of it and walked away. Don't torture your child with this."
3,"My oh my is this cocoa sweet. Too sweet I'd say. You're better off making hot cocoa from scratch. I bought this because I thought the minty flavor would be good, but it's too sweet. So are the dark and milk chocolate flavors."
3,"Good thing I got this from the bargain bin or I would really be perturbed. Whatever the claims, this mix has no chocolate flavor of any kind. A more correct description would be Coconut flavored drink mix. Apparently the 10 oz rating is including the weight of the ""cauldron"" because there's no way there was 10 oz of product inside. You might get three cups of ""hot chocolate"" per container if you like the ""flavor"" really mild.<br />It really wasn't worth the price I paid and certainly not the inflated regular price. Two of the three cauldrons were dented heavily so those won't even be much use as decoration. Look for a better brand."
0,Ive been looking for this brown rice tea like forever! I just can't seem to find this in the groceries so i didn't hesitate getting one when i found out it was on amazon. thank goodness! it's so YUMMY! it feels like I'm in Japan
4,"We started buying 100% meat diets on our vet's recommendation for getting our big fatty to lose weight on a ""catkins"" diet.  Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved.  The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better.  They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey.  We mix in some Wysong ""Call of the Wild"" into the meat.<br /><br />Turkey is their 2nd favorite fowl, more than chicken, but less than quail.  My understanding is that cats naturally eat small fowl and rodents, so quail is actually the closest to what they actually eat in the wild.  I have trouble imagining a kitty cat taking down a big ol' turkey, but you never know!"
0,"As I'm not much of a tea drinker, so I gave this to my wife (who is from Japan) to try out before I tried it myself.<br /><br />In Japan, tea is a big deal.  The tea (the leaves as well as the tea itself) has to look good, smell good, and overall present itself as something of great refinement.  No Japanese would offer another person tea that was less than wonderful, except maybe at the office.<br /><br />If the eyes are the window to the soul for Americans, the tea a person serves is the window to the soul of Japanese people.<br /><br />So my real expectation was that my wife would open up the canister, maybe try some herself once, and it just wouldn't pass enough to serve to anyone else.  Wow, was I wrong.<br /><br />She opened it up with her friend, who is also from Japan, with the disclaimer that I got it from Amazon.  Clever Japanese strategy.  If it was coffee, I'd be offended as coffee is my thing, but tea is alright.<br /><br />They loved it right away.  They said, ""Come here.  Smell this.  It's a wonderful aroma.""  They added a few obligatory potential criticisms like, ""This isn't from Japan I suppose.""  And then they drank it.<br /><br />You have to understand, these two ladies drink nothing but the best.  It has to be great or they wont serve it.<br /><br />My wife has served me this tea every day since.  It's that good."
4,"Judging how swiftly my cat eats this food she truly likes it.<br />Plus, apparently it's a good stuff for older cats because it's a non-prescription and easily found dry food with one of the lowest phosphorus levels (0.73%), which is quite beneficial for older cats' kidneys.<br />I can heartily recommend it!<br />Especially at such fantastic (and unbeatable anywhere!) price at Amazon."
1,"Flavor is light, mostly strawberry, as is the can. Switch is all-natural fruit juice, and the ingredients are a shortlist of -- well, carbonated fruit juice. Big thumbs up, when you compare the list on every other soft-drink can. The portion size is 8.3 oz., which probably less than you're used to in a canned drink. The Switch seems to me to be a wonderful flavor, satisfying. It was a pleasant experience without guilt. Try it and see for yourself."
1,"It tastes light and fizzy.  I liked the taste but would not 'switch' and buy this instead of my favorite juices/pop.  If someone handed it to me, I wouldn't refuse it."
4,"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.<br /><br />When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package."
3,"A wonderful taste surprise that has spoiled me for all other hot chocolate drinks there ever were.<br />MOCAFE Azteca D'oro 1519 Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate is a rich, creamy, spice surprise that is not your mama's hot chocolate. If you are a hot chocolate drinker don't miss this."
4,"I really wanted this food to work, as it seems to have good ingredients for a decent price.  However, my cats, who are typically ravenous little mongrels, don't even bother to check it out when offered.  So much for saving a couple of bucks--now they eat Organix."
1,I liked this flavor of theis carbonated fruit juice but I will admit that there are flavors I did like better.Also this product should be drunk very cold for maximum flavor.If you like carbonated fruit juice then this product is for you
1,"This is a tasty drink that is a nice alternative to soda since it's 100% all juice.  Other reviewers have mentioned that it has a tart taste to it, but to both me and my husband (who is the primary soda drinker in our family), it tasted sweet, with no aftertaste.  As my husband put it, it's sweet with a little tanginess, so that it's not overly sweet.<br /><br />Although this purports to be primarily kiwi and berry, the main juices it is composed of are apple and grape.  It is also high in calories:  a small 8.3-ounce can has 135 calories.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a nice change of pace, and it's worth a try if you're looking for a healthier alternative to soda."
3,"I'm giving this product 5 stars because I think it is great considering that it is made with water.  The hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size.  If you want a large cup of hot chocolate, use 2 k-cups.  It is fairly low in calories, most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little k-cup."
4,"This is the best cat food for my feral cats! The 40 lb size is a great buy, and the cat food is good for them! you really can't beat the price for decent food for feeding a lot of cats!"
2,"My daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this.  We tried 3rd foods on her and she doesn't like the texture of them.  This is really good for her and she likes it, so we keep buying it."
1,"The initial taste does hint of something, but then the apple and grape juice filler comes to fore and dominates the after- taste.  Comparing this to the Black Cherry drink, Kiwi Berry has a better taste and after taste.  However, if you would have told me that this was the Black Cherry flavor, I would have thought that to be true.  I could not note any significant difference between flavors.  The carbonation offers no benefit in the taste or feel category.  The price is high - about $1 per 8 oz can.  If I want juice, I'll stick with real juice without the carbonation."
2,"Ok, sounds crazy i know but i heard about this baby food diet and figured whats there to loose. The food tastes good, and im sure your baby will like it too hahaha!"
0,"I have been drinking oolong tea for several months now. I find it quite a nice morning beverage instead of coffee. It is also a great pick me up in the afternoon. One of the benefits of oolong tea is increased energy, which for me it works. This oolong tea is great tasting and light flavored. I will definitely continue to purchase it."
2,"I purchased a bag of the blueberry & apple tiny fruits excited to try something different for my 9 month old child. Seeing that the product said that it was for ages 6 months, I thought it would be o.k. since my child is well passed that age, eats finger foods and is crawling. Unfortunately, the blueberries do not easily dissolve in the mouth. This product is a choking hazard. The company's mission is good. Hopefully they will be able to fix this issue."
1,I'm so addicted to these!!! You know the movie When Harry Met Sally? When I drink one of these it just feels like that famous scene in the movie... orgasmic!
1,"I tried the Kiwi Berry flavor. I really liked the taste. It was sweet but not too sweet. It had a lot of carbonation so it was bubbly.<br /><br />If you like fruit flavored soda, I think you would like this product."
1,"I've now tried several of the Switch drinks. They're not bad, for a carbonated juice drink, especially. This, actually, was one of the better flavors I've tried. It's got a nice orange juice type flavor that I enjoyed. Ultimately, these drinks remind me of Apple Beer, which is essentially carbonated apple juice. I love that drink, and think Switch could try an apple version of their product. I'm sure I'd love it as well...<br /><br />That being said, give it a try. It will quench your thirst, and I'm sure it'll do well in the marketplace. It fills a void where very few drink manufacturers have entered."
0,"I don't even really like tea much but this tea is amazing. I love it. Flavorful and even therapeutic, it's a tea I crave during colder months & am bummed when I run out."
1,"It seems that soda wasn't as good as when I was a kid, and people have pointed out that it might be the high fructose corn syrup that is making the taste more dull.  Well, this orange soda is made with real sugar, as well as a few extra healthy things, and the taste is much, much better than the regular orange sodas you might find otherwise.<br /><br />The price is about in line with what you'll find in a soda can and the taste is great.  Why would you drink the HFCS mentioned earlier that is just horrible for your body when you have this option?  I highly recommend it, I thought it was quite fabulous."
1,"I really liked the tatste of this.  It actually tastes like you're getting the juice from a tangerine...I think the carbonation gives it that zing taste you can only get biting into an tangerine, orange, etc.<br />My daughter, however, really didn't like it.  Not sweet enough for her.<br />I think it's a little pricey, not sure I'd be willing to plunk down that much for it~~the can is very small, 8.3 fl. ozs., which is a proper serving of orange juice, which makes it around $1 a can, or a little less.<br />But overall I truly enjoyed that zinging tangerine taste!!"
2,"my  whole family love it, even my six-years old twins like the salad prepared with it! healthy and yummy."
0,Love this tea. Has a very mild flavor but that's enough for me. Received some as a Christmas gift a few years ago. Been addicted ever since. Just can't find it in a store any more. Have to order it here.
1,"This is very good.  A nice berry flavor with just a hint of kiwi, and very sweet even with no added sugar. The fruit flavors are strong, but very natural, without the unpleasant mouthfeel and aftertaste some fruit beverages can leave you with.<br /><br />The carbonation is nice - it's not too bubbly, but just pleasantly effervescent.<br /><br />This is a product I would definitely buy at a convinence store instead of a soda, but I had to take away one star since I think it is a bit overpriced for what it is."
2,My little guy loves to try new foods..so this variety pack is great.<br /><br />Feeding organic is the way to go. We trust and love the earths best brand<br />Ther formula is great. Amazon.com seems to have the best price around i checked.<br /><br />It is great to get the auto ships of babyfood..less trips to the store for dad !
0,"Being married to a person from England, as most people know, they are known for their custom of having tea in the afternoon and always being made in a tea pot with loose tea. It is getting harder too find this in the stores and we are ever so grateful that we can buy it through Amazon. This is our favorite brewing tea and it tastes great! Wouldn't get any other and the price is fantastic. So,if you are a tea lover like we are, give it a try.<br />Thanks for letting us keep up with tradition!!!!!"
1,"what can i say that will actually be published about this splendid drink. It is carbonated sugar water. As per usuall the grape, apple juice content seems to always dominate in fruit drinks (unless they're suppose to taste like grapes or apples). The calories and carbs only seems high but in reality compared to a regular soda drink it is much worse since the quantity is greatly reduced in these drinks (Switch brand can 8.3oz regular can 12oz). They however make no pretensions of being a health drink with the exception of their pure juice declaration. All in all nothing shocking here, especially as we grow used to paying a lot for a little in todays economy."
0,"Delicious, flavorful tea.  A must for cinnamon lovers.  It also has a pleasant sweetness that even those of us who don't use sweeteners can enjoy. Wonderful as a hot drink, but I especially like it as a cold drink."
1,"I grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a 'healthy' Crush. That would be a NO. Of course, tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it's that much sweeter. Adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy, ultra sweet drink, not unlike cough syrup. Proceed with caution. Perhaps kids would find it super tasty."
4,"We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.  That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we'd give it a try for our cats.  I'd had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really ""feeling better"" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it'll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life."
1,"A good drink, about 3 WW points. I mean it's about what you'd expect from an orange soda- expect it's all natural, so you recognize the things on the ingredient label.<br /><br />Downside- really a lot of calories for such a small can!"
2,"My daughter loves Gobble Gobble.  I was a little surprised to see the reviews that said it is dry and tastes bad.  I wonder if those were bad packets.  The ones we've had have always been moist.  The food is a little bit bland, but it is not recommended to feed babies salt or spices, so it's about what I'd expect.  I like this better than the Chick Chick because it has a firmer texture.  To me, the Chick Chick is runny.  I normally spoon feed this to our baby, but if I don't mind cleaning up a mess I sometimes allow her to eat it with her hands.  We've never had any problems with gagging or choking.  When the packet is empty she's still looking for more.  I make most of my daughter's baby food and am very particular about what packaged foods I give to her.  I feel okay about this one because there are no weird preservatives and I can identify all of the ingredients."
4,"My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years. I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different. They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food. I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat."
2,This is seriously the ONLY food we have purchased that my baby rejected EVER.  She has eaten everything we've given her.  Poor thing gagged and gagged every spoon I tried...
2,"My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.  Not all the time, but often.  The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.  He won't eat much when he's in pain, but these are easy on his gums.  They are organic and a quick meal.  My son is strong and a very healthy weight.  I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible.  Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.  He loves the whole line."
4,Our cat was having some problems with urinary tract infections.  This dry formula plus the Pro Plan canned formula for Urinary Tract Health seemed to get her completely cleared up.
2,To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible. Up all night screaming from gas pains. Garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies.
3,"I ordered this after having much success with their liquid products. It is not bitter at all and has a very fresh/clean taste to it.  I have baked with it, used it on the stove, and in my oatmeal and hot cocoa.  When I run out, I'll be ordering more!"
4,"As with most cats I've read about here, both of mine gulp these down without even the slightest tooth mark in them.  This can make them vomit so my trick is to snap them in two so then they have to chew them because of the ragged edges.  I""m used to the snapping since I have Persians (they have smaller mouths than a regular Tom does) and these aren't hard to snap at all.  They love the taste of these although I'm not all that sure they really help with the furballs.  Does anything really help though?! :)  I do recommend these because of the great taste, but try snapping them in two if your cat has trouble vomiting after gulping his/her food."
1,"I bought this Baking Soda to clean my teeth 3 times a week.  They say that teeth become noticeably whiter.<br />But you've to to be very gentle while brushing and use ""soft"" type tooth brush.  I did notice a difference.<br /><br />Also, I noticed that when Baking Soda was mixed with water, the PH indicator showed the highest level (almost 8.5-9 on the chart).<br />This may explain why Baking Soda is so effective to fight germs.<br /><br />It's a good product."
4,"This cat food has great, healthy ingredients.  Cats shouldn't eat grain because it is not a part of their traditional diet.  (Think: Mice, Rodents, Moles, Grasses, Rabbits, Bird, etc)  I switched my cat from Iam's canned food to this one, thinking that I would have to mix them together at first to get her to eat it.  However, she ate it immediately! I was so happy!  As another reviewer said, there are whole peas in this stuff.  It looks a little gross, but my cat eats it. However, I must admit that she will eat just about anything.  Her favorite treats are sproated oat grass, spinach and broccoli stalks.  She's a good eater!<br /><br />Before I switched to Felidae Grain free, my cat was vomiting frequently.  I think it was due to food allergies (either to grain or food coloring maybe)  Since switching she has only thrown up one time! You can only imagine how happy I am to not have to clean up vomit every other day!<br /><br />Also, since switching my cat's fur is much more smooth and soft!"
3,Makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop.  Not as sweet as I would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in suspension.  I guess I can add marshmallows:-)
0,"This tea was horrible.  It tasted like potpourri.  I have really enjoyed other Davidson's teas,many also containing flowers, and thought to try something new.  I think the last ingredient is where things went bad.  It was ""natural flavor""  which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all."
0,"I totally love this tea.  It brews to a beautiful reddish color.  It is very aromatic and beautiful to look at.  It could be potpourri.  I love the sachets it comes in - very elegant.  I just bought my third canister of it this morning.  I have everyone at my office and my friends loving it, too!  Best with honey pearls also sold by White Lion Tea.  And it's organic!"
1,"The taste of The Switch Kiwi-Berry, reminds me of Jell-O fruit flavored pops.  I happen to like this flavor, but I wouldn't call it Kiwi-Berry.  The name ""Kiwi-Berry"" seems little more than a gimmick since the main fruit ingredient in this soda is apple.<br /><br />The Switch is high in calories, but at least it doesn't include high fructose corn syrup.  The ingredients listed seem to be natural and I do not feel sick after drinking it (as I normally feel after drinking corn filled sodas).<br /><br />I recommend The Switch Kiwi-Berry for people who like fruit flavored sodas without high fructose corn syrup.  Those on a diet may want to avoid this drink since it contains more than 100 calories per serving."
0,"Based on my local source for this tea, the Amazon price is a bargain - almost 1/3 rd less.  I am a daily tea drinker and this is my tea of choice.  I like it strong.  With the Rishi Earl Grey loose tea, I can brew it as strong as I like and it is never bitter or metallic.  No chemical flavors here either.  The tins are a useful bonus around the house, too.  Highly recommended."
0,This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it.
0,"Yes the water appears clear, but once the water is heated for tea it turns the tea cloudy. Why is that, well it means it has impurities. Perhaps bacteria?? I'm a Registered Nurse not a water expert, but I can tell you that I am right about the water. I can run my well water from my tap and get the same results, it's awful.  I normally use Brita filters with the pitcher provided and when I heat or even boil the water the tea stays clear. This Means no bacteria have been killed off by the heating process, it means you'd be better off drinking the Brita water!!!!!! I gave this bottle water a chance I got a second case and the same thing happen. I wouldn't drink this water straight from the bottle ever. As a nurse I know it's not a good idea.  If you ever want to know if water is good or clear of bacteria/impurities you can make Lipton tea hot then, as it cools down IF the tea turns very cloudy it has dead bacteria and other impurities. I used the ice cubes made from this bottled water as well, so nothing is different except the tea.  Tried the Brita water and Brita made ice cubes and it remained clear.  Sorry not a good review from me I am afraid.<br /><br /> I was very disappointed as I thought ""yeah"" a bottled water I can carry to work, so I am not force to pay $1.50 for a bottle from the machine, but it turn out not to be so.<br /><br />Okay, so I tried another company on this website Nestles which in my region came as Deer Park. I have never tried this brand but it is so much better it doesn't,t turn cloudy when I boil it.  So you be you own judge."
1,"As advertised this product puts only a small amount of carbonation in the drink.  The taste is similar to Orangina but with a much more pronounced juice taste and mouth  feel.  It actually leaves a thick taste in your mouth similar to when you drink orange juice from concentrate.  It is a bit high in sugar but at least it is natural fructose sugar from the fruits (again, similar to real orange juice) as there are no added sugars.  Certainly not a calories conscience drink but not bad.  I do think the can is way too small but then again any more and the sugars and calories really soar."
1,My daughter & I were excited about trying this flavor as we both love orange juice.  This product did not impress us enough to order it as we liked other flavors more. My son also tried it and didn't care for it. The orange tangerine flavors are masked by the other fruit juices and makes it taste odd.  I like the fact that has added Vitamin C and is a healthy alternative to sodas but the flavor on this one needs tweaking.
4,"I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select."
1,"I love this flavor the best for it lightness, but zesty and orange tanginess.  Very refreshing taste and not over powering with no additives; what a plus.  nice carry size, but why should such a good thing be in such a small size.  Good that the product is in a can - recyclable.  there are other similar carbonated-juice out there and this is definitely one that could compete with the low-saturated market."
3,"It's difficult to find 20 words to say about Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts, Milk Chocolate Toffee, other than DELICIOUS. They didn't last long. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing."
3,The hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size. I find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa.  The best bang for the buck I have so far found for hot cocoa.  I tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee.
4,"I advise you to do your own web search to determine how the health risk could affect you. The tomally functions as the lobster's liver and pancreas. However, even in the cold Scottish waters, dioxin and other harmful agents have been present and there are warnings for the general public. I was disappointed to discover this information, so I only ordered the mushroom and seafood flavors."
0,"I have been drinking this tea for years and I am happy with the exquisite taste that comes from naturally grown Black Sea region tea. No pesticides/chemicals have been used in growing this tea, it is pure, it is natural, it is rich in taste and above all it is healthy.<br /><br />It is produced by CAYKUR (Rize,Black Sea Region,Turkey), Turkey's government enterprise for tea-processing.<br /><br />Caykur's Altinbas is usually priced higher than other Caykur brands.<br /><br />It is loose tea so you need to have a set of two teapots, one at the bottom for boiling water and one at the top for brewing tea."
0,"I found this exact same stuff at the dollar store.  It is pretty good.  Not as good or as strong as my loose whole leaf tea, but for the price it can't be beat. Bags are never as good as loose leaf.  I use it if I want one quick cup.  I steep my loose leaf tea 2-3 times, so I have to have time to drink 2-3 cups.  I gave this 4 stars because it is a good deal for the money purchased from the dollar store. If I make myself a mug, and because it is cheap, I use 2 bags.  I would have been disappointed if I had paid the original price on here for it though."
1,"Great change from artificially flavored soda, but it was almost sweet enough to be a concentrate. We mixed it up 50/50 with club soda and it was perfect!"
2,"This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.<br />I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us."
1,"This is the greatest soda drink on the face of God's green Earth! I've been drinking Pepsi since I was just a little kid. Classic taste. Much better than that garbage called Coke. Anyone who never tasted Pepsi before... Go now and get one! If you have a store near you, buy a case! If you have a vending machine near you, Take a crowbar and open it up! If you see a Pepsi truck driving down the road, attach yourself to the underbelly of that truck. Drill a hole into the truck and crawl up inside it! Then taste the nectar of the Gods that is Pepsi!"
2,"My whole family loves these. They are tasty and convenient and the packaging is recyclable to boot. Perfect for in the kids lunch and to take in the car, as they are not messy like a cup of applesauce and a spoon."
0,"First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom...not explosive diarrhea.<br /><br />With the way we eat (mostly women) we need to clean out our plumbing every once in a while and this is a fabulous way to do it. It's not recommended for everyday use!"
2,I believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches. It now has a sour after taste and my son hates it.
1,"This can of juice was delicious.  It reminded me of the Orangina beverage.  I did find it strange that they chose to package this product in a can normally associated with ""Energy Drinks"" like Red Bull since they market it as ""All Natural"".  Nevertheless, it's yummy and I recommend it!"
1,"This is a wonderfully refreshing citrus drink.  Not too sweet or too sour & just enough bubbles to make it sparkle.  I would imagine it could make a great addition to a punch, if you chose to add it to your favorite fruit juice.  The only draw back for me, is that it is a tad bit too expencive to replace our families normal beverage of choice but it sure does make a terrific treat to keep around for an occational indulgence."
1,"This orange tangerine juice bills itself as having ""100% of what you want"" and ""0% of what you don't want."" It is pure orange and tangerine juice with a bit of carbonation, but no added sugar, preservatives and carbonation.<br /><br />Of course, that's all great, but the big question is how it tastes. I'm pleased to be able to say it tastes pretty good. It has a bit less zip than I usually prefer in my orange soda, but a nice orange / tangerine flavor and no noticeable aftertaste. I would definitely try this again if I had the chance."
0,"I love this tea.  I can drink it all day long, and I find it very comforting and satisfying.  It is especially pleasant on a cool or stormy day."
4,"This slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it. Our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet!<br /><br />She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newman's Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL09S"">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a><br /><br />Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.<br /><br />In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman's Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products. Nice.<br /><br />Just say NO to Science Diet and Felidae Grain Free Formula. Here's the good stuff: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK8HJ0"">Newman's Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable Formula for Cats, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />(Did they really want me to post a video with this review? Would you? Then its unanimous, this review will remain video-free!)"
0,"This is a good tea that has a nice flavor. My only complaint is that for a rich tea, you have to use extra tea bags. This is sold in bulk which helps off set the price for using more tea bags."
1,"Four people in my family tasted this orange tangerine drink.  It tasted good to all four people, and agreement from all four is difficult.  It does not taste like a soft drink, but much better.  If you are looking for a fiz that is tart, this is your drink."
1,"The taste says fresh-squeezed quality fruit. The carbonation content is lower than some drinks of this variety. This ratio makes for a heavier juice drink. Though a delicious treat, especially with breakfast on the deck, I prefer to save a few calories (140 per can) and have more carbonation."
2,"My baby loves this apple sauce. He didn't like the gerber brand at all, but yummys this down right away and I like that it is organic."
0,"I love this tea served as Chai latte, served with milk and honey. In fact, I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk and it gives it a lovely creamy taste. I am no expert on Chai Tea but then, I go by what I like, and I find this particular blend very pleasing. I would recommend it to anyone who like spicy teas."
1,"I suspect this drink is an acquired taste. After the first sip, I was reluctant to take another. The second sip was an improvement and the third even more so. By the end of the can, I was finding it fairly enjoyable.<br /><br />It was only after I had finished that I noted the Alka Seltzer-like aftermath. Yuck.<br /><br />Still, I am sure I could get used to it after a few more tries. This is, I think, the problem with the drink: I would drink it because it presents itself as being good for me, not because I was blown away with taste or a feeling of refreshment.<br /><br />I would not buy it again."
3,"Delicious chocolate cups, each in its own aluminum holder.  I could not find these in any local store, so was happy to find them on-line.<br />Most people are unaware of them, so they are impressed when I serve them a little cordial or other liquor in a chocolate cup.  After sipping the<br />liquor, you can eat the cup.  What could be nicer?  Excellent product."
2,"I purchased this for my mother who is currently undergoing some powerful chemotherapy. During her first chemo, she hated everything because everything tasted like metal and it was short of pulling teeth to get her to eat something. She called me and asked me to order her this because an oncology nurse that she is friends with suggested it. During her second chemo she ate all her normal foods and actually enjoyed it making the entire process of eating during chemo a small miracle. We were so happy that she was eating because of this that we ordered more immediately!"
3,The Cocoa wasn't too bad. The taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes.  I was disappointed though when I went to a local store and saw it for less than what I paid just for shipping.  I really thought I was getting a good deal until I went home and checked the ticket.  I just paid three times as much for a box of hot chocolate to be delivered to my house! SO DISAPPPOINTED!!:(
1,"Sparkling juices aren't anything new and the Switch simply gives us more of the same. Whether you are drinking Welche's Sparking juice or an Izze, it comes down to flavor, nutrients and cost.<br /><br />Izze flavors are Apple, Pomegranate, Black Cherry, Grapefruit and Clementine.<br />Switch offers Orange, Watermelon, Kiwi-Berry (the flavor I tried), Black Cherry and Fruit punch.<br /><br />Also Izze gives you 10% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, B6 and Niacin.<br />Switch gives you 100% of your daily vitamin C.<br /><br />Izze currently is $21.62 for 24 cans at 8.4 oz.<br />Switch is currently advertised at about a buck more for 24 cans at only 8.3oz cans.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />With Switch, you pay a similar cost to get more vitamin C and different flavors than offered by the main competitor.<br /><br />Could a vitamin supplement give you more of what you really need? Sure. But it's not nearly as fun as drinking any of these sparking juices.<br /><br />So if you need a more healthy alternative to soda, determine if cost, nutrients and/or flavor is your thing then try a Switch or an Izze."
4,My vet recommended this years ago for my cat who has a digestive tract the size of dental floss. Always got at Pet Smart. Cheaper on Amazon and delivered right to my door.
2,"I was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. I wasn't really impressed when my son tried the food. The consistency was WAY too thin, and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. I would recommend making your own baby food, or use the Gerber organic."
0,"For this tea drinker, Rishi's loose leaf Earl Grey tea gets a certified 5 stars: 1) dark, earthy, elegant and informative packaging--good for the aesthetic at heart 2) USDA Certified Organic--good for the body 3) Certified Fair Trade--good for everyone involved  4) smooth and strong quality of flavor and texture in the loose leaf--a measuring standard for all Earl Grey teas 5) Earl Grey has always been my morning drink of choice, and Rishi's is the perfect excuse to continue this tradition!"
2,"This ""squeezy fruit"" as my daughter calls it, is great.  Convenient, yummy, no added sugar...I love it.  I just don't understand why it is so expensive??  I find it at the grocery store for $2 for a four pack.  Don't pay this price, that's crazy!"
1,"Looks can be deceiving, especially with this product:  The cute, tiny can looks great, but don't fall for it!  This little guy packs an amazing 140 calories per 8.3 oz can.  My favorite 24 oz Arizona Iced Tea(black/white tea with sugar) has almost just as many calories(150) and almost 3 times the size of Switch.  Also, do not be tempted with ""100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin E"" pitch either.  Most of us consume 100% of daily Vitamin C without even trying through foods and anything extra get eliminated.<br /><br />The taste however does feel a bit more natural than other artificial orange sodas though, so that's the only plus.  Also, if you do not worry about gaining weight, I guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can.<br /><br />Overall, a good-tasting product, but there are many other low-caloric alternatives out there.  A can of Diet Coke and a multivitamin anyone?"
3,I ordered this as the price was certainly right (6 1lb cans for less than $30) and the reviews were good.<br /><br />This is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market. Better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket. I certainly prefer hot chocolate - but it can be time-consuming to make and it's tough to heat milk and melt chocolate at work or in class.<br /><br />This is the perfect compromise for when you want that chocolate drink and aren't in a position to 'do it right'.<br /><br />Very good taste and dissolves well. I always use a little more than it says on the can - with some cocoa that means it won't all dissolve - this is not a problem here.<br /><br />Certainly recommended.
2,this makes feeding on the go so easy! my one-year-old will suck down a pouch in 5 minutes and she loves them!
1,"This drink completely drew my taste buds into a hypnotic feeling of bliss.<br />The fruit in this drink tasted like it had been freshly picked from some exotic country, and blended to perfection with carbonation.  Delightful!"
1,"This is an Amazon Vines review of Switch Carbonated Juice Drink.  The flavor I received was Kiwi Berry and the can is 8.3 fluid ounces.<br /><br />I seldom drink sodas, not really caring for sugary drinks.  So when I saw the Switch 100% Carbonated Juice offered I wanted to try it.  The flavor I tried had a good tasting Kiwi flavor, was not sugary, and had a nice carbonation to it that I really enjoyed.  The refreshing drink has just 135 calories and only 15 mgs of salt, so as I drank it, I did not feel like I was drinking an unhealthy sugary beverage.<br /><br />I think this product is a great substitute for soda, provides a nice ""pick me up,"" and is a much healthier product for one to drink than many sodas or other types of drinks that have added sugar, corn syrup, or some type of preservative.<br /><br />I enjoyed this drink and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a healthy and refreshing 100% juice drink."
4,I tried this out with I believe the six pound bag (or close to that size) and my cats loved it.  Upgraded to the 20lb bag and still very satisfied.  Gave my kitties meow mix in between purchases and they snubbed it.  Better keep stocked up on this!
2,"I love Gerber organic products like this which combine veggies and/or fruits. I bought one of the ""Farmers Market"" from the regular grocery store to make sure my 8 month old liked it, which he did. I bought a case from Amazon, but the consistency was like soup, very runny unlike the one I bought from the store. Heating it up made it worse. Maybe it was a fluke, but the second case from Amazon ordered a few months later had the same problem."
1,"I was intrigued by this product.  Once it arrived, my son was as well.  So, I shared it and anothere flavor with him.  My assessment was that it has a pleasant taste but--unless I had read the can--I am not sure I would be able to identify it as Kiwi-Berry.  It also has a slight aftertaste--not unpleasaant, but just there.  Also, I am not too sure I need the carbonation with fruit juice.  My 8 year old son on the other hand loved it.  He raved about the taste and the bubbles, claiming it tastes like Sprite only much better.  He seemed to like this and the other flavors about the same.  I would suggest this as something to try, but hesitate on buying more since the price is realtively high compared to other beverage options."
1,"While the flavor of Jolt Blue has changed due to the change to corn syrup from sugar back in the day, it's still pretty much the same thing that it always was.  It's still tasty (and where else are you going to get blue raspberry soda?) and it still packs the same caffeine punch that it always did.  Tasty, and in the classic bottles -- what more could I ask for?"
1,"At around a buck a can, very expensive for 8.3 ounces of carbonated apple juice (with lesser amounts of grape juice, aceola whatever that is, raspberry juice, and finally actual strawberry and kiwi juice, plus some vitamin C added).<br /><br />With the 100% juice banner all over that can, you might be led to believe it's 100% strawberry/kiwi juice . . . it's not. Taste is not unlike a typical Strawberry soda pop, but not quite as good.  Expected sugar content (natural). 135 calories. I'm not likely to make future purchases of this one."

1,"This was a weird drink - I had high expectations, but the flavor was just odd - it really did taste like fizzy Tang drink mix.  However, my kids really liked it, and I think it is a great alternative to junky soda, so I will most likely buy more - but not for ME to drink.  ;)"

1,This is the second flavor of this line of drinks that I have tried (I have also tried the cherry one)  It was a nice fruity flavor and I enjoyed the drink. I love the fact that this beverage has no added sugar.  Just beware that that does not mean that there is no sugar as you get a lot of sugars from the fruit juices.  I think that this is a great drink and would recommend it to people my only real major complaint is that the cans are too small and I really feel that I need a second can to quench my thirst.  However if they were much bigger then I think the sugar content would be bigger than a regular can of soda.
3,I have purchased the Oskri dark chocolate with coconut bars and absolutely loved them! This time the dark chocolate was not available so I tried the milk chocolate. I figured they wouldn't be as good as dark chocolate since i prefer dark but thought they would still be tasty. The package I received was dented and the chocolate bars were melted. It makes it hard to open since each bar is bent and chocolate is stuck to packaging. The bars themselves taste a little stale. Needless to say this purchase was a big disappointment as I love coconut and chocolate.
3,This is my family's favorite hot cocoa brand. The kids favorite flavor if mint chocolate.
3,I don't really like the chunks of cherry and pistachios.  I'd just rather have the plain dark chocolate.  I think the plain dark is the best dark chocolate sugar free bar available today.
2,"I have a 6.5 month old who eats #2 food all of the time. I bought this variety pack and noticed that the peach oatmeal is thick like a paste. Coincidentally, as I was thinking that as I was feeding him he started choking and gasping for air.  He couldn't breathe and I had to give him the heimlich maneuver and luckily he started crying.  VERY SCARY and those jars went right in the garbage."
1,"I've read a few reviews for this product complaining that it's too sweet to drink truthfully. I'm a soda drinker but I usually stay away from fruit sodas as they do tend to be sweeter to taste than say a cola or root beer. To me though The Switch billed as a healthier alternative to soda had a less sugary taste compared to something like Fanta or the like that was perfectly fine I suppose if it truthfully was healthier than soda. Personally I never really go for the idea of alternatives and with the price of the product, the ammount given I wouldn't really recommend it over regular water or just drinking some type of juice. Then again if you really must having something billed as a healthy alternative to soda then its not bad I suppose just not something I'd be interested in personally."
1,I really enjoyed the Switch Kiwi Berry can I received. It is full of flavor and is very good. If you enjoy energy drinks then I recommend this one.
1,"Chill a can of The Switch Kiwi Berry,<br />pour into pretty wine glass,<br />relax and enjoy.<br />Repeat...<br /><br />The Switch Kiwi Berry has an aesthetically pleasing color, tantalizing fruity taste, just enough carbonation, a pleasurable experience. -- Katharena Eiermann, 2009"
2,"These are not awful if eaten with a cup of tea, coffee or milk -- but they are very dry if eaten plain.  I do like how they have less sugar than most granola bars and are not a choking hazard for toddlers like hard snacks can sometimes be.  I am a fan of the oatmeal raisin mini cookies, and of the regular size EB cookies, but this flavor tastes very fruity to me and not very chocolaty.  I think the double choc cherry tastes better than these.  Happy to have them for last resort snack-on-the-go needs, but not my favorite."
3,"The hot chocolate was very tasty, but pretty expensive for hot chocolate. You can buy hot chocolate K-cups in most retail stores and some grocery chains and it is the same thing for less money than advertised on here."
0,"This is a very good tea as far as teabags go...traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas, But this is the exception...being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas(White tea is the least processed of all teas)...teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of...these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas(the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance)... and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money...It took about six weeks to finally get delivered, but it was worth the weight...This one is a no brainer...!!!"
0,"This is my third order of Lipton loose Tea.  It isn't easy to find in our local stores, so I really like to be able to depend on Amazon to provide this product for me.  Excellent product and service and recommend this all."
1,"This fizzy fruity soda tastes great and has no added sugars (including all the hidden ones). Tastes great, but for those who think this is a lo-cal drink, nope: 135 cal per can. Has added Vitamin C (100% RDA). Like most fruit mixes main juice is apple/grape, but kiwi, acerola (a wild cherry fruit), strawberry, and raspberry are listed in the ingredients. I thought you could taste flavors beyond the apple/grape combo as well."
1,"I've tried three flavors of this product so far:  Black Cherry, Watermelon Strawberry, and Kiwi Berry.  My favorite so far is Kiwi Berry that I thought was very good.  Watermelon Strawberry was second, and Black Cherry was a distant third.<br /><br />This product has a lot going for it, in my opinion.  100% fruit juice, so healthier than soda, but with added carbonation to make it different than just plain juice.  To me, the amount of carbonation was just right - I was able to drink it quickly and found it very refreshing.  The serving size is good, too.<br /><br />I do wish that it was available in larger sizes, even if someone didn't want to drink it all at once.<br /><br />My rating for the flavors, based solely on my personal opinion, is:<br />Kiwi Berry:  5 stars - would buy again<br />Watermelon Strawberry:  4 stars - would drink again, but probably won't buy again<br />Black Cherry:  3 stars - would drink again if very thirsty, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it"
3,"I enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate on a cold day. This is okay. You can't expect much when when all you use is water. I would say it is a bit better than the instant hot chocolate packets, but not by much. What I like the best is the easy factor. I can let my 9YO make her own cup without worrying about pulling hot water out of the micro and spilling it all over while trying to mix it like you do in the packets. So for that alone its a great deal. Price is not the best, but again the convienience is key."
1,"On the face of it, THE SWITCH Orange Tangerine beverage sounds quite good. It's a mix of concentrated fruit juices with mildly carbonated water. No added sugar, preservatives or caffeine are there to annoy the health-conscious. You get 140 calories from one 8.3 ounce can. (Probably too small a serving for most people.) There are small portions of natural flavor and coloring, gum acacia, ascorbic acid (i.e., Vitamin C) and soy. In case quantities, it's priced at under a dollar per can. Sounds pretty decent, right?<br /><br />The trouble is: it just doesn't taste that good to me. There is a vaguely unpleasant metallic quality to this stuff that I can't imagine many people warming up to. Perhaps the juice has reacted with the aluminum of the can. Perhaps my can had been sitting on the shelf for too long. Perhaps the acerola juice in the mix is an acquired taste; it's something I haven't tried before. Perhaps I got a bum can. Perhaps THE SWITCH just plain sucks. I really don't know, but I do know that I won't be drinking any more of it in the near future."
1,"The Switch Orange Tangerine is one of the most refreshing drinks that I have ever tried. It is 100% pure orange and tangerine juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious. Right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there. After drinking it, you may never go back to regular sodas again. It works well by itself or with a meal. This may be an ideal substitute for sodas for kids, as it is a much more nutritious drink. The only problem that I have is the size of the can. At 8.3 ounces it may be enough for a kid, but you would need more than one of these to quench an adult's thirst."
1,"I seldom drink carbonated beverages, but tried the Kiwi Berry since it sounded interesting and had no added sweeteners or preservatives.<br /><br />I was sure surprised by the very light carbonation, which I enjoyed, plus the taste was really, really good.  It is not too sweet and has a very nice, fruity taste.  I more or less expected something along the lines of a flavored  Pepsi or a Coke.<br /><br />I think the size of the can is just right for me.  I would not want something larger.  I believe it has a few more calories than a Coke, but the flavor is very refreshing and if I had my choice, I would drink the Switch drinks especially the Kiwi Berry."
0,"This is the best Gunpowder tea you will buy for the $$. It's perfect for everyday green tea drinking. The tins are individually foil sealed so you can take your time getting through the lot, or share with friends and family. I usually take a tin to work and keep one at home. Some specialty grocery stores in Dallas carry the loose teas, but out in the suburbs, Amazon makes it easy and convenient. I priced this out one time and it's $$/oz is incredible bargain, the same tin at specialty grocers (Whole Foods, Central Market, World Market) is like $6-$8. Unless you have an Asian market with a bulk tea section close to you, probably not going to get more affordable.<br /><br />---Preperation<br />Use filtered water if you can, I get it from my Fridge since it has filter on the water in the door.<br /><br />~165-170 degress F (I stick a probe digital thermometer into the whistle hole on my stove-top kettle and set the alarm to go off at 165F, gives me time to get from the living room back to the kitchen without it getting too hot. I have the tea portioned and waiting for the water in my teapot, 6 tsp)<br /><br />~3-3:30 minutes steep time (covered)<br /><br />Do not boil or steep longer than 3:30 or it will become overpowering and bitter. If you like it stronger, add more tea.<br /><br />I alternate with the Twining's Prince of Wales loose (~195-200F, 4min steep time), it has become my favorite black tea.<br /><br />No cream or suger needed if you brew it correctly. The green tea can be reused for another brew, I typically add a tsp or two to the already brewed leaves and good to go.<br /><br />The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I68NCS"">Finum Brewing Medium Basket, Black</a> is a perfect partner for your mug/pot at work. I just use the hot water tap on our coffee machine over the leaves in the basket, 3 minutes later you have perfect green tea at work with easy clean-up.<br /><br />Enjoy this tea!"
4,"My cat loves almost all the ""Fussie Cat"" flavors, and the this one most of all. He's very picky, so I'm pleased to find something he'll eat reliably. It also seems to be of good quality and is quite reasonably priced."
2,"This was much chunkier than I expected.  Our baby still can't handle lumpy food, so he wouldn't eat it at first.  But after I pureed it smooth, he loved it."
2,I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old.  Plastic!!! in food!!!! baby food!!!  So please be careful if you buy this or are considering it.<br /><br />My daughter LOVES this food-- it's actually her favorite.  This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months.
1,"I enjoyed the flavor of this orange soda.  It was not overly sweet and the orange flavor had just enough tartness to it.  I am glad it does not have any HFCS in it, but the calorie count is still quite high from the natural sugars.  All in all, if you are looking for a good orange soda, try this one."
3,I don't know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about. I tried Ghiraradelli's premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.
0,"I have bought several Revolution flavored teas.. white pomegranate and sweet ginger peach (not sweet but nice peachy ginger taste) and I loved them. However, this tea is not too good.. there is no pear flavor! not even a subtle one.. it is a bit bitter and really just like a plain white tea. If you like that, fine, but don't expect a pear taste!"
4,"My finicky cats are difficult to please particularly when it comes to their food.<br />Boy,....was I finally RELIEVED...when they chowed down on these!!!"
3,Very good hot cocoa.  And price was right<br /><br />Awesome and passing the word on the item.  Will buy it again
4,Great price and my cat loves this food.  He has been on it for 9 years.  My vet says he is the healthest cat he sees.
0,"I grew up on Yunnan tea as a child - it was always my mother's favorite - so I was happy to find an economical source of it of a quality that was great for a ""large volume"" habitual tea drinker like me. This tea is my daily regular tea. Yunnan is nice in that it will brew dark so you do not need much at a time. It's aromatic and flavorful without any additives. If you want something that is flowery yet more subtle than Earl Grey this Yunnan or a Keemun may be a nice option to explore."
1,"When I ordered this drink, I hoped that it would provide a sweet, somewhat more healthy alternative to my usual soda fix.  I wanted to be optimistic, but after the nasty aftertaste from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, I didn't hold out too much hope.<br /><br />I was really surprised at how refreshing and tasty this drink is.  I tastes mostly like strawberry, with a slight hint of grape.  The carbonation is very mild and makes the whole thing keep from being too syrupy or tasting too sweet.<br /><br />This is now my favorite way to get 100% of my daily Vitamin C, which is a lot more than I get from Coke."
0,"A good rich, malty, bready assam that can stand up to milk & sugar.  As usual don't over steep an Assam.  Wonderful value for fair trade organic!"
1,"The grapefruit and blackberry flavors are the current favorite at my house on Tuesday nights when we try to always have a rotisserie chicken and homemade gravy while watching TV.<br /><br />Once you taste the subtle fruit flavors mingling perfectly in a not overly carbonated sparkling water, you may want to order this by the case.<br /><br />There are no artificial flavorings or colorings, not to mention extra sugar. The only sweetener is grape juice and apple juice concentrate. Lemon juice and fruit concentrates mingle with the sparkling water to create a delicate, smooth, slightly tingly and delicious drink.<br /><br />Perfect for drinking with dinner or taking along on a picnic.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
1,"Juice consentrate is very good. I like it as much as the Tart is Smart and with the price increase it is considerably cheaper even with subscribe and save. This will be my staple tart cherry juice from now on."""
4,Our cats just love this stuff.  They eat the Ultra Premium dry food and Ocean Fish canned food.  We've given them some of the other formulas and they'd slowly eat them but they won't leave the Ocean Fish alone.
2,"My 15 year old loves, I mean adores this treat! I can be assured that she's getting joint nutrients at the same time. Wish it were made in the USA. Maybe some day soon we'll have our own product."
3,I had 6 sample packets 1.25 oz. My oldest daughter 12 yrs loved it with whole or 2% milk. Have used some mixed with my morning coffee. Best Hot Cocoa mix I've tried.
1,"My husband thought this was alright, but I just couldn't get myself to drink more than a few sips. Let me also add that I am not a soda drinker so this may be a great alternative for someone who is(hence the two stars), but this is an opinion from a non-soda drinker.<br />I had a hard time tasting anything close to Kiwi or berry. It was more cherry or ?? to me. I would've liked a little more fizz to it, I consider it just lightly carbonated. Also, I cannot imagine consuming 33grams of sugar in just over 8oz, it tasted WAY to sweet for me.<br />It kind of bothers me to see 'natural flavors' listed in the ingredients too...like what type of 'natural flavors'??? I would've hoped all the mixed fruit juices would've been enough..."
1,"GREAT LITTLE DRINK,NICE FLAVOR. WILL PROBABLY ORDER MORE SOON . RECOMMENDED AS A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE TO SODA POP."
0,I love the licorice tea so I thought I would love this too.  But the mint is too strong and you don't really get the licorice flavor.  I'll stick to the Egyptian Licorice instead.
4,"I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me."
2,"My 10 month old son has been a fan of Yummy Spoonfuls from his first bite. The Garden Medley flavor is a new favorite. The puree is thick and almost creamy, perfect for a baby who likes his food to have texture. He's always happy when I bring a cup of this to his tray!"
0,"I drink three cups of this each day, made with one Oolong tea bag and one green tea bag, in a large mug.  I believe this has helped me to lose about 8 lbs. in the last five months.  I drink it without sweeteners, and also cold. The price for this is very reasonable, and the taste is mild."
0,"I was excited to purchase this tea and found out thats its not good.  I brewed it on small setting and big, very weak, not of quality.  I have one of the Raspberry and one lemon I have to figure out how to get rid of."
1,"Last summer, our family discovered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC734G"">Izze Sparkling Juice Variety Pack - 12/12 Oz Btls</a> and used them for special treats on really hot days. They were refreshing and because they did not add any sugar we could fool ourselves into thinking they were healthy (they are healthier...)<br /><br />When we saw Switch, we thought we might be getting even more of the same in new flavors.  Unfortunately, these are more syrupy than the Izzy's.  At least for adults, the are less crisp and refreshing.  However, kids would of course prefer these as they are sweeter.<br /><br />We also tried Watermelon/Strawberry and we liked the Kiwi Berry better.  The watermelon/Strawberry had a much more Jolly Rancher like taste. I think we are going to stick to our Izzy's I think."
0,"This is a great Tea. I use a french press to make my Tea. A lot of people use a coffee maker, And I have too in the past.<br />I have found that if you use a french press and hot water from your water dispenser and let it steep as per the instructions this will be the best tea you have had in a long time. Don't take my word for it TRY IT."
2,"I am so done purchasing ANY and ALL other fruit snacks for my 3 and 1 year old now that I have found Little Ducks ! I was given a bag from my friend Stephen in NC.  He told me that they were the BEST snack nutritionally and financially for my little babes.  I opened the bag and started sampling them myself.  I wanted to taste what I would be feeding my children.  Before I knew it,  I had eaten HALF the bag myself !!!  I got myself composed and feed them to my two little ones.  They both handled the tiny snacks into their mouths, and soon the bag was COMPLETELY  empty !  Let me just say,  WE love them.  So glad to see we can purchase them on line for easy and convenience.  They will remain a staple in my home.  We eat them straight out of the bag, put them on organic yogurt, and also mix them in our oatmeal and cream of wheat.  Great product for EVERYONE to enjoy!!"
0,"I am attracted to reliable consumables which do not vary much from batch to batch. I expect the single malt scotch I purchase this month will be similar to the one I bought six months ago, all things remaining the same. In my experience, I have had Ahmad Earl Grey Tea that's knocked off my socks with a rich flavor, filled with the bergamot that attracts me to Earl Grey. The box I'm currently drinking is so full of tannin and void of essence of bergamot that I don't know if it will actually be drunk. All boxes I've had contained tea bags with an ample amount of tea and each produces a satisfactory little teapot full of caramel colored tea, but I am having difficulty drinking the second cups from this box because the tea powder residue remains. Instead of enjoying an afternoon of relaxation, I develop a stomach ache, so I'm now skipping the entire second cup.  The tea was recently purchased, so staleness is likely not an issue."
4,"Although this seems like a great product it is definitely not minced.  The cans say it is minced but it isn't, it is ground beef.  My cat ONLY likes minced.  Not chunks, not ground.  Although she will eat ground cat food sometimes, it has to be inviting and delicious, yet she just walks away from this.<br /><br />I hate it when the packaging lies about the contents of a product.  The shipping was speedy and the value is great (as long as they deliver what the promise) now I am stuck with food my cat wont eat at all."
0,"If you like their teabags, this is really worth a try. The leaves in the teabags seem to be the tea that is rejected when they package the loose tea. This tea has a brighter taste than the tea bag Lipton."
4,"We used Royal Canin Indoor Mature 27 Cat Food after having used Royal Canin Indoor 27 regular formula.  Not only did our cat's coat improve, but her feces do not have the unpleasant odor they used to have when she was fed other food.  She is now 13 years old and extremely healthy.  This food is expensive but worth it!!"

1,"""Boylan Bottleworks""<br /><br />AS a charter member of ""Free Associators Anonymous,"" the company name is ripe with conotation: Pittsburgh. Giant pipes of metal and glass with sweaty workers downing a ""Boylans"" (or, shorter, sweeter: ""Hey, Trow Me a 'Boys'!""  Ironworks, manholes made in Oakland, tough immigrants, and cherries blacker than coal. Coupled with The Bottle Americana, even a non-serious soda flavor like cherry has a certain gravitas, a don't-screw-with-me style, even though I'm rich enough to afford this.<br /><br />Speaking of serious, let's get on with the parlor game of tasting notes. Boylan's Black Cherry, as noted by others, isn't too sweet (cloying as the wine connosieurs will tell you), syrupy, and it tastes like cherries, especially upon entry and in a very satisfying aftertaste. However, a grape/apple flavor sneaks in under all this, so much so that I was surprised that Boylan uses cherry juice only.  It keeps Boylan's from perfection, just as the Amazon price may give you pause.  (Trader Joe's does it again--will this company ever do an IPO so that we can all get rich off its well-deserved popularity.<br /><br />Back to Boylan again.  It's strong enough to stand up to ice, the fizz is moderate--you don't lose half your cherries to foam--and it's quite tasty and refreshing. Again, the only minor problem I had was the perception of a grape juice filler, perhaps my imagination, or perhaps a characteristic of one of the varietals in Boyland's cherry blend. The competition is from other designer sodas (Kemper's, for example), and from cherry sodas made with the artificial flavors and colors that we all grew up to love. At this price, it's a treat, and the taste is so good it'll disappear quickly, but you're a working man or woman. You deserve this liquid luxury presented with no-nonsense attitude."

0,"I was so disappointed to find that the two stores I shop in had stopped carrying the loose Lipton tea.  This is the only tea I use.  There is a difference between it and tea bags and I'm thrilled that I can buy it on line (and as an added bonus, it's cheaper!)thanks so much"
0,"This tea is very similar to Paromi Coconut Almond I have bought at Whole Foods.  Unfortunately, I don't live near a Whole Foods!  This loose leaf tea is awesome!  I was first put off by what I considered to be higher than normal shipping charges, but the cost of the tea is so CHEAP when compared to buying it in tea-bag form.  I will probably get 50 cups of tea out of this package.  The flavor is so unique...I can't wait to try it this summer in a sun-tea jar."
4,"What can I say? It's cat food but without stuff in it cats shouldn't be eating. It is her favorite flavor, but that depends on the cat."
4,"bought both the savory seafood and the chicken and wheat germ, as the kittens liked the fish, chicken and liver flavor.  They are not so fond of it, but will eat if there is nothing else.  Also, they will only eat it as soon as a can is opened, there is no hope of putting half a can in tupperware and feeding it to them later. Oh, yeah, and STINKY.  But a good product if your kitty likes the taste."

0,"though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did"
1,"How much can you say about a drink? It tastes pretty good! It's got a nice flavor, sweet, but not overly so and there's a good amount of fizz. There's a lot of sugar for the amount of drink you have, and at only 8.3 fluid ounces, there just isn't much there. What's there is good though!"
4,"My cats go INSANE for these treats. I am a veterinarian, and my cats are pretty spoiled. I have bought all kinds of treats, the Evo ones, the Friskies temptations, the Pounce, the Greenies, the moist hairball treats; you name it.  One of my cats is a piggy; you really can't trust her opinion. She'd eat anything.  However, my other cat is super finicky, and she simply adores these treats.  I also love that these appear so ethically made.  I can't always say a product is green just because it is green on the label; lots of manufacturers dupe consumers into buying ""natural"" products that aren't any healthier than the feline equivalent of a Snickers bar.  But after reading the label, I can't say I seriously knock this manufacturer. The ingredients look pretty good.  Can't say Amazon is the best place to buy these treats, though.  I saw em for 3.99 at another website.  So shop around, but when you get a good deal on these treats, buy them.  Your kitties will thank you.  And follow you all around the house begging loudly."
1,WOW!  I am a PEPSI-holic and was gaining weight as you can imagine. A little 85 year old woman introduced me to your tea HOT.  AND now with just A LITTLE bit of honey and ice I have a nice cool refreshing drink!!
4,"I have 2 cats.  One will eat anything.  The other one is soooo picky.  She's had to have some of her teeth removed due to a mouth virus, so I needed to find some good soft treats.  She likes these more than anything I've tried.  They are really thing little tiny strips.  I like Wellness, all natural products.  Both cats like their brand cat food as well."
0,Save your money and buy a better quality tea than Lipton Loose Tea.  Tea is better than the bagged version but you will want to pour it through a fine filter before drinking because the leaves are broken and some are just very small particles.
0,I was drinking Stash loose double bergamot earl grey and needed more... I tried this on a whim and I LOVE IT... There is tons of bergamot flavor.  This really is a very delicious tea and I won't be buying any more Stash.  This is all I need.
2,"Now that my daughter is 2, I really appreciate that the HappyTot pouches really seem to keep the toddler's needs in mind, by offering a good size portion pouch for them, great flavors and especially this one, is my daughter's favorite in the veggie options.  I tasted it too since the combo of Sweet Potato, Apple, Carrots really seemed like a ""Thanksgiving"" meal to me and wow, it was! It's like eating a pureed version of the Thanksgiving Meal side dish!  I loved this side dish with my Turkey so it's so funny that my daughter does too.  Chock full of Vitamin A, being organic and all veggies and fruits, it's a great snack for her and meal supplement to her other foods.  The portability is perfect and that extra dash of cinnamon, makes me have a great respect for the company which shows how they really want the product to be tasty while maintaining the healthy offerings too!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VBPN2"">HAPPYBABY Happy Tot - Stage 4: Sweet Potato, Apple, Carrots and Cinnamon, 4.22  Ounce Pouch (Pack of 16)</a>"
0,"This is a delicious tea!<br /><br />I'm just now becoming a tea geek and really exploring the stuff I like, and Earl Grey is amongst the top, especially with bergamot.<br /><br />The problem I find is the amount of bergamot added is usually too little, or too much.<br /><br />This one is perfect! I really like the balance in the flavor. I don't add anything to this tea, just a part of a teaspoon in a cup and in 2-3 minutes it's ready.<br /><br />Tastes like an expensive tea but priced like Lipton. Definitely recommend it for fans of Earl Grey with a kick!"
0,"I am very happy that I brought this Lipton Loose Tea as this loose tea is what we had when I was a Child and its is still as good as I remember it was then ,are better tea than any of the other's tea that are already in a tea bag the flavor of this tea is what a glass of tea was supposed to be likes.I will always buy the loose tea now that I found a supplier I have looked in all of the big name brand super markets and never found any loose tea.I got mine order to come in every three month now but may have to get mine order up from one box too two boxes .."
1,"This flavor has a much more mild flavor than the Black Cherry flavor I reviewed earlier.  While the juices in this can are apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry in order of their respective strengths, the strawberry flavor stands out the most.  I enjoyed this flavor more because the sweetness was not overpowering and the carbonation remained light so I didn't feel like I wanted to drink a glass of water immediately after.  It's a little expensive for an 8.3oz can but I'd purchase this again."
3,"I love this cocoa. I place it in my Kurig with 1/2 C of water, make the cocoa and add another 1/2 hot milk...so creamy, great taste. It is still good with water but the milk adds a creamy texture..YUM"
2,"I love this product! I have several of these that I got for my daughter. She makes her own baby food for our grandchildren. But I have some as well. When the kids come to our home, we keep snacks, fruit, and dry cereal pieces in the cups for the children to enjoy.<br /><br />During the summer we use this to make frozen fruit or yogurt pops. It travels well and cleans up easily. Just an excellent item that I wish had been around when I was a young mom."
1,"This drink wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It's supposed to be Kiwi floavord but the  it doesn't quite make what it's going for. It does have a sweet fruit juice flavor and is carbonated as the description describes, but somehow they don't blend well together. I think kids would like the flavor. They would be easily fooled into thinking they're are drinking soda. But for an adult it is overly sweet."
1,I put this in the kids lunches for school.  They loved it as it made a nice change from straight fruit juice or UHT milk - it tasted like a soda to them but I loved that they were getting the nutrition of the fruit without the extra sugar.
1,"This relatively expensive convenience-packaged item is 100 percent juice and contains 140 calories worth of concentrated apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice reconstituted with carbonated water; acacia gum; some soy; and added vitamin C to provide 100 percent of the adult minimum daily requirement. There are no artificial flavors or additives which allows the manufacturer to describe this as a ""natural"" beverage.<br /><br />I often mix juice with seltzer water, and I like the combination quite cold. The Switch Orange Tangerine tasted more like orange soda with a tangerine chaser than what I am used to as juice flavor.<br /><br />The carbonation makes the drink seem lighter than juice, but not as light and refreshing to the mouth as juice and seltzer.<br /><br />The tangerine flavor made the taste seem more appealing than orange soda, but the orange and tangerine flavors don't last as long as soda flavors do on the palate.<br /><br />I would drink this again on a hot day if I could buy it inexpensively enough."
1,"The ingredients on this item show several natural fruit juices, but the first one on the list is apple, followed by grape.  Kiwi & Berry juices are further down the list.  I know this is actually fairly common in beverages that have multiple tastes...apple and grape become the ""base"" and other juices are added in moderation to create a convincing flavor in which the taste of the apple and/or grape fades to the background.<br /><br />Not so in this case of the Kiwi Berry Switch.  It tasted, to me, like apple juice with sparkling water added.  This in not a BAD thing...I kind of like that taste (having spent many years in Germany, the ""Apfelschorle"" (sparkling apple juice) is a commonly served drink which I always enjoyed.  HOWEVER, I was expecting something that tasted like Kiwi Berry...and in this I was disappointed.<br /><br />It's nice that SWITCH makes these sodes without any corn syrup or other additives...just juice and carbonated water.  They're still high in calories and sugar content though...so it's not exactly a health drink.  And I wouldn't say it's worth paying more than I would for another ""regular"" soda.<br /><br />It's a refreshing drink, but I can only give it the most lukewarm recommendation because it doesn't taste like what the can promises, and offers only modest ""health"" reasons, none of which really justify a higher price."
0,The tea is good and fresh. We enjoy it. The shipping is fast and cost is reasonable.<br />I recommend this product.
2,"I was just going to reorder the ""Bit-O-Honey""  Last me a long time and I enjoy eating it slowly in my mouth... Just like a kid!"
3,This hot chocolate is much better than other k cup hot chocolates I have tried.  It is not watery.  I have tried both the milk and dark chocolate version and like them both.
4,"I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it."
1,The carbonated version of the orange Celcius drink is the perfect drink for first thing in the morning.  It starts the day off on the right foot.  I have been drinking a half can of celcius each morning for a couple of years and as long as I can get it (Amazon is the very best place to buy) I will keep starting my day off with Celcius.
0,"Lady Grey is practically the only tea my family and I drink. First we bought it because of cornflowers, which are kinda a symbol of Russia, where I was born, but we stayed with it for the taste. Try it cold with lemon - it's amazing!"
0,"This is my absolute favorite tea.  So many teas just taste too bland or watery to me.  The licorice mint is delicious, needs no sweetener, is soothing to the stomach, and caffeine free.  I look forward to a cup before bed each night.  And with Subscribe & Save it's almost half the cost of buying in the local stores!"
2,"The bananas are a little runnier than most brands, but overall, my son loves this stuff.  And what a great price!"
3,"I am so glad that this hot chocolate is available for Keurig.  Previously the brand of hot chocolate available was only so-so, but this is definitely better.  The variety pack is just right for every mood and every guest.  I never find myself with too much of any one flavor left over.  Move over coffee lovers, we cocoa drinkers have found a home!"
0,This is a great product. Shipping was fast as usual and I plan to keep on getting tea from Amazon as long as possible.
3,This is excellent hot chocolate for those of you that love love hot chocolate- go for it - you will love it to... I would purchase this again.
1,"This stuff is great.  It will mess you up and it tastes great.  What me and my friends like to do is combine this vodka with root beer, it tastes just like a root beer float.  Or orange soda, which makes it taste like creamsicle.  It's kind of expensive compared to other vodkas.  But if you like sweets like me and want to get a little drunk...then try this vodka."
1,"Was looking for a way to bulk purchase Sugar-Free Kool Aid. This fit the bill and then some. I am trying to cut back on soda for the family, so this was an excellent way to do it. Cheaper than the store (although not by much) and always available (something the local grocery store could try). This was my second set of these and they are just as fast and just as good as the first. Oh and the Sugar-Free part, can't tell the difference, Great product!"
4,"My youngest cat is very particular about what he eats.  He absolutely will not eat if something doesn't meet his expectations.  Between that and the recent pet food recalls, I've had a really hard time finding cat food that I can feed him.  I'm happy to say that the Merrick Turducken clicks with him, plus it has no wheat gluten or other fillers.  The texture of it is appealing, too . . . it's not just ""mush"" or Spam-looking like many foods.  I'll continue to buy Turducken and plan to also try out some of the other Merrick flavors."
1,Expecting something like Fanta or Sunkist I was surprised how smooth and subtle Switch is. Definitely a good combination of refreshment and flavor. Love the fact that it doesn't tast too carbonated.
0,"You know I love my English Breakfast (see my earlier 5 star review of Twinings English Breakfast) -- but my greatest delight is Earl Grey tea -- with its deep, smokey, heavy (but not burdensome) mysterious wonderful flavors that linger hauntingly on the tongue and bring sublime moments of joy into a grey day (no pun intended). Steep it long enough so that all the flavor intensity is in your cup (or tea pot) Drink it straight, with no sugar -- OR-- sweeten it to bring out even more of its wonderful flavor -- AND for a special treat, add cream or milk or soy milk-- your Earl Grey will take on a ""Chai presence""!!! Either way, Twinings Earl Grey is a tea to look forward to time and time again.<br /><br />Lady Grey was new to me, and yes it is a bit lighter and not as intense as the Earl himself, but Lady Grey is still very very good -- notably so.<br /><br />Irish Breakfast is a tea that may make you break out in song -- it is robust and delightful, clearing up ""morning fog"" in a hearty way.<br /><br />This is a very good variety pack, IMHO, to keep on hand at the office when having panel meetings or board meetings -- or just in the ""break kitchen"" for folks to enjoy when they are want a tea break!! Wonderful flavors and aromas like these can't but help to make people sit up and notice, and make a sometimes dull work-day (or...ahem...meeting) more enjoyable."
1,"This product is like orange juice that is fizzy. It reminds me of another product, Izze , but this product is slightly sweeter and isn't as carbonated as Izze. I would recommend this product, just make sure it is cold because it tasted alot better cold than warm."
0,"I've been enjoying this particular blend of chai for quite a while.  I actually don't even want to add milk or sweeteners.  I think it is mellow all on its own but could understand the appeal for some to use milk.  I'm not a fan of sweet teas so I wouldn't want the sugar or honey traditionally served with chai.  I've even used one tea bag with a bunch of regular tea bags to make some iced tea that's quite nice in the summer.  Folks who have tried it who often want sweetener in their tea tell me it's not necessary with this combination.  Hot, it makes a great mug to hug.  Yumm!"
3,"I love all of the cocoa in the Stephen's Gourmet line, but I think this one is my favorite. The other people in my family have different favorites (we all love Stephen's), but we all agree the Belgian Dark ranks at the top for the best all-purpose drinking cocoa.<br /><br />I like my cocoa with a little added milk in it, and starting out with a good DARK cocoa allows me to achieve that milky texture without sacrificing that rich chocolate flavor.<br /><br />As an added bonus, Stephen's cocoa is labeled ""Gluten Free"" -- taking the guesswork out of choosing a cocoa for those of us who must avoid gluten-containing additives such as barley malt (a common ingredient in chocolate)."
3,"It is indeed a ""rich and creamy chocolaty delight"" if you use the smallest cup size on your machine.  Remember to shake the box well before using.  Some cocoa still remains in the K-cup after brewing, but regardless, you get a very satisfying cup of hot cocoa!"
1,"Silly me, I didn't read the packaging terribly closely. I was actually rather pleasantly surprised. Basically, it's carbonated fruit juice from concentrate, or as they say: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola [cherry] juice concentrates).""<br /><br />Gone is the usual second ingredient in such beverages: ""high fructose corn syrup"" or the old standby ""sugar""...<br /><br />Basically, it reminds me of a carbonated version of Tropicana Pure or one of the Odwalla beverages, watered down just slightly (not quite as sugary, but still pretty darned sweet).<br /><br />Overall, I rather liked it. It's a bit smaller than your typical Pepsi or Coca-cola can. But I could see it being handy for kids' lunches and such. Slightly better than typical ""soda"" with corn syrup. Though I'm not sure whether it would be preferable to straight up fruit juice...<br /><br />Personally, I'd rather have the fruit juice (like a Hansen's smoothie or something, granted they're a bit sugarier)... But some folks like carbonated beverages. So, why not make one out of actual fruit juices rather than all sorts of more artificial stuff?<br /><br />Rather liked the Orange Tangerine one. I'm interested now to try some of the other flavors and see if they're as good. Especially <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40"">Kiwi Berry</a>... But possibly also <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">Watermelon Strawberry</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH2C"">Fruit Punch</a>."

4,"Neither of our cats was the least bit impressed with this product. The flakes did arrive as scheduled, but remain unused except for small amounts that were presented to the cats in various ways in hopes that they would find the flakes appealing. No joy."
1,"This was a very interesting drink! It was refreshing, tasty and healthy! It was very Tangerine tasting, no after taste and very refreshing!"
3,Very tasty.  You do need to remove the top and scrape out the remaining cocoa to really get all of the flavor.  This is what we have had to do with every brand of cocoa we have bought.  The flavor is excellent.
3,"We love this variety box in our house, we subscribe to ensure we never run out.  I use the 'Dark' to make Mocha, my wife loves the 'Peppermint' and i drink the 'Milk' whenever i fancy a hot chocolate.<br /><br />The Dark makes a great mocha, just do half a cup of the Dark Cocoa and half a cup of your favorite coffee, add whipped cream on top, delicious.  Also worth noting, you can try some of the flavored coffees in your Mocha and rustle up some great combos. I am not a fan of flavored coffee, i struggle to drink a cup but as a Mocha, delightful.<br /><br />Drinking the Peppermint or Milk as a hot chocolate, we add a little milk and whipped cream on top, delicious.<br /><br />I highly recommend this variety box if you are considering buying it. :-)"
0,"I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called 'Tejava'. That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle. I needed something less expensive so I tried this 'Prince of Peace' brand Oolong.<br /><br />After a few brewing experiments, I now love this stuff.<br /><br />What I have learned; If brewing as 'sun tea' this type of tea seems to come out very weak. If you put this tea in boiling water, it may come out bitter.<br /><br />I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is, very hot to the touch, but no way near boiling. I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes (I like strong tea). I have, to my taste, duplicated the 'Tejava' brew at a fraction of the original cost.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />Ken"
2,"My 14 month old loves this stuff--it's a little chunkier than some of their other products, but it's a great introduction to solids!"
4,"You have to get kitty used to them, as they are kinda rubbery, and smell funny. My cat took to the treats well, after a bit of coaxing; and sometimes if she doesn't eat them, I just pinch them in half, and she gobbles them up. My cat is equally fond of both flavors, salmon and chicken; If I don't store them away properly, the next morning I find the pouch torn and chewed up.<br /><br />This is a great treat if you can't/don't grow cat grass."
2,"My four kids LOVE these, it's great that there's zero nasty stuff in it like grocery store 'fruit' (ie total chemical junk) snacks. A 'safe' kid snack!"
0,"If I had to point out a flaw in this variety pack, it would be that there's no light flavor (i.e. green tea) to round out the mix. Short of that, I can't imagine anything I'd complain about with this mix.<br /><br />English Breakfast: Strong, dark, and goes well with a dash of milk if that's your thing. A solid way to wake up, any day.<br /><br />Irish Breakfast: It's hard to say this blend tastes lighter than the English, but it makes you feel lighter. Great with a full Irish breakfast, the Irish blend really makes you happy to meet the day.<br /><br />Earl Grey: Twinings brand actually bears the seal of the (or, an) Earl of Grey, and it is probably the best Earl you can get from a bag. Great for any occasion, especially for Star Trek nerds like me who can't help but chuckle and mumble ""Earl Grey- hot"" with every mug.<br /><br />Lady Grey: A remarkable inclusion, Lady Grey is based on the Earl flavor. Whereas the Earl tastes of deep orange, the Lady has a very light dash of lemon. Lady Grey is an excellent and complex treat, good for relaxing or just plain enjoying your tea. Lady Grey is light and aromatic, without being a gimmick tea like so many other brands are willing to push. This is a serious tea, and yet it still has a sense of fun.<br /><br />This mix has it all. You've got your strong standby flavors that are great in the morning (English and Irish), you've got a great anytime flavor (the Earl), and a superb treat flavor (the Lady). Short of making the jump to looseleaf tea, you just can't find better flavors than this."
3,First found this hot chocolate on the Museum of Natural History of all places. There's a great blend of sweetness and spice. It's so yummy!
0,"If you try to buy tea in one of our major cities and are approached by some limp-wristed purveyor trying to sell you one of his ""artisanal"" blends packaged in a paper bag with an attractive or colorful label, do not scoff but leave the premises in as diplomatic, and polite manner you can muster.  Tea has been and always will be an expensive commodity, and with good reason; its irresistible flavor depends on volatile compounds either inherent in the tea or added to enhance its finished flavor. The operative word here is ""volatile"" which is synonymous with ""fleeting"" and in the world of tea quality, packaging is everything. With Twinings tea you are getting a tea with the maximum protection; a foil-sealed metal can, for goodness sake.  Twinings delivers it to you with the understanding that you will enjoy the flavor that they meant for you to have so that you may return to them as a source of quality teas again and again.  Of course, once you've opened the can it's up to you to keep the can closed after use until the tea is all gone. I prefer loose tea and Twinings is my supplier of choice.  Twinings has so many varieties for you to choose from, there really is no reason to go elsewhere. We may have sent those Redcoats back to England with their tails between their legs but we still have a lot to learn from them when it comes to tea. Lady Grey is an especially tasty blend, you'll enjoy it."
1,"The names of these juice drinks rarely really reflect the majority of what is actually in them.<br /><br />Ingredients: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c).<br /><br />I've never heard of acerola and I want to know what the ""natural flavors"" are.  Anyway, its really mostly apple and grape. Of course, you probably don't want to drink pure kiwi and berry juice, they are just the ""flavor"".  So, this is a lighter flavored alternative.  I like that the carbonation isn't overdone.  There's just a bit of fizz.  Its sweet, but not horribly.  Its definitely better than soda and I like it better than the other carbonated juice drink that I have tried (other one had too much carbonation).<br /><br />I get irritated that the nutrition facts are so brief.  Surely this stuff provides more vitamins and minerals than vitamin C.  Did they kill the vitamins in the manufacturing process or are they just not telling us what is there.  If its there, you'd think the company would want to advertise it.  If it isn't, where did it go?  (BTW I have this gripe about most nutrition labels).<br /><br />So, its a good drink, probably good for you and definitely better than soda."
0,This tea is amazing. I drink it iced with sugar and lime. It will blow your mind. The taste is similar to a flavor of kool-aid that I had as a child. I can just drink glass after glass of this tea.
0,"Initially I purchased this in good faith for brewing it as iced tea as it is quite difficult to find loose tea leaves in stores. Here's my initial report and impressions:<br /><br />The tea leaves came loose of course but the packaging is terrible. The bag is not sealed and the flap is just folded so tea leaves came out of the bag while in transport. So a lot of your tea leaves will be inside the box which is not good. I would hope that in the future Lipton chooses a better packaging alternative to seal the bag so you don't have tea leaves all over the place.<br /><br />And as another reviewer mentioned, it is true that this particular brand has little bits and pieces of tea leaves and is not as good quality compared to other brands. And as always, you pay for what you get. I didn't expect this to be better than my Jasmine tea in a tin can which costs about $45 and taste fantastic. My goal was to buy cheap black tea leaves which are loose to make lemon iced tea which I was able to do well with that.<br /><br />Here is my lemon iced tea recipe after a lot of trial and error and taste testing:<br /><br />-1 Gallon of Lemon Iced Tea-<br /><br />1. 1 Gallon of water<br />2. 5-9 Tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea<br />3. Empty teabags<br />4. 1 cup of sugar<br />5. 1/2 cup of lemon juice<br /><br />Lipton's direction call for 2 tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea to make 1 1/2 quarts of black tea to drink. We know that 4 quarts is equal to 1 gallon, if we used 4 tablespoons of black tea we would only end up with 3 quarts of tea which is short of one gallon. If 2 tablespoons makes 1 1/2 quarts then 1 tablespoon would make about .75 of a quart. So you would need at least a minimum of 5 tablespoons or even about 5 1/4 tablespoons of tea leaves to get your 4 gallons. I would not recommend using more than 9 tablespoons as it would make the tea too strong. Some people have said that the tea is too strong for the little amount that you use to brew your tea but I would have to disagree with that. I thought the tea wasn't strong enough.<br /><br />So go ahead and boil your water till you hit the boiling point. Use between 5-9 tablespoons depending on how strong you want your tea to be and fill up those empty teabags. The directions call for brewing your tea for about 3-5 minutes. Being a tea drinker I knew that if I brew it too long that tannins would be released and make the tea bitter (yes! tannins are what make your tea bitter). If your water is too hot or you brew your tea too long the tannins will be released in the leaves making your tea bitter. Initially I only brewed my tea for about 2 minutes because I was scared that the tea would be bitter if I brewed it too long. But I found that 2 minutes time was not enough time and increased my time to about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes. That is enough time to brew the tea without releasing the tannins so Lipton's brewing time was about spot on. After you finish brewing your tea add your 1 cup of sugar and then your lemon juice. I used cane sugar and Hy-Top reconstituted lemon juice but you can use whatever brand you like or you can even use fresh squeezed lemon juice if you want. I did try Real Lemon Juice while at another supermarket but I didn't like it compared to my generic brand of lemon juice by Hy-Top.<br /><br />You probably wanted to know if I actually drank the tea without it being Lemon Iced Tea, and I did. I didn't like it nor would I recommend you drink this tea this way. I just did not feel that this tea was up to quality compared to many other brands. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other brands but I just feel that this tea wasn't up to par against other black teas nor do I recommend drinking it as just plain black tea. I particularly like the English Breakfast Black Tea by Stash better than this tea. I just felt that the quality difference was a lot but I didn't feel like buying every bag for $0.09 each every time I went to the supermarket just to brew Lemon Iced Tea. If you want to make lemon iced tea with the Stash brand you need 9 English Breakfast Black Tea bags and the same amount of sugar, lemon juice, and water. Economical wise I would get more tea buying Lipton but if taste matters I would choose another tea brand to make Lemon Iced Tea.<br /><br />I haven't tried making Raspberry Iced Tea with this yet but we'll save that for another adventure."
3,"These chocolates are made in small batches in Kohler Wisconsin. We use to drive to Kohler to buy them. It's good to know that you can order them on Amazon. Each piece has an amazing combination of flavors and textures. I particularly enjoy the ones with molasses, they are called Blackstrap terrapins. Let me know if you like them."
3,"Best K-cup hot cocoa on the market, bar none. Would not be without it in the house, especially with the winter months coming."
2,"My son has been eating the multi-grain super greens with gusto from when he was 8 months old. He likes it cold or warm. Yes, it's quite plain tasting to our grown-up palates but in my opinion great for the little ones. I started putting some cracked pepper and herbs on it more recently. Sometimes, I serve it as a snack, sometimes as a side dish to meatballs or chicken. Highly recommended."
1,"We've all loved our carbonated drinks. Some of us have gone through (or are in the midst of) real addictions to coke and diet coke. Of course these drinks have caffeine and who doesn't need caffeine. But another attractive feature that leads to addiction is carbonation. Who doesn't like that fizzy feeling?<br />So, why not take a reasonably healthy drink like 100% fruit juice and make it carbonated? Brilliant! You get the sugar rush (but healthy sugars!) and the carbonation, without the crazy ingredients of most soda drinks.<br />You'll never need a mystery-fruit-flavored high fructose corn syrup, Yellow Dye # 9 concoction again!<br />I just wish the cans were a little bigger. This is one drink that can afford to be super-sized."
0,I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.
1,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this citrusy, fizzy drink. It was okay, though not something I'd buy often, and certainly not worth the price in my opinion.<br /><br />It wasn't as orangey as I expected and it wasn't until I had half of it gone that I read the ingredient list and saw why--orange juice is actually the fourth juice listed on the ingredient list, with apple and grape juice first and second, and the tangerine that seems to tone down the sweetness slightly the third on the list.<br /><br />When you look at the nutrition information, this product has about forty more calories than Coke Classic, and despite not having any *added* sugar, the grams of sugar in this product is MORE than an equivalent amount of Coca-Cola!! The only bonus of this over ""real"" soda is the Vitamin C and A...there isn't much else nutritionally to speak of."
3,"I enjoy a good cup of Hot Cocoa on occasion, and this is ""good stuff""!!  Not only that but in a time where prices are out of control on K-cups, this product is very reasonable in price."
0,"I really enjoy the Yogi Licorice tea and was really wondering how mint & licorice would work.  So, I finally ordered and am so pleasantly surprised.  This is delicious and I will be replacing the straight licorice with the licorice mint in future.  So nice to curl up with."
2,"I used to eat this all the time when I was a kid but unfortunately, they stopped producing it for a while. Then suddenly, its back again. I love it! Its really, really tasty :)"
4,"i'm giving this a solid 5, because my old but healthy cat loves this stuff and it's wicked good for him, but i'll tell you right now that this stuff looks and smells quite gross; as long as i don't have to eat it, it's all good."
1,"This product advertises that it is a soda made from 100% fruit juices and is refreshing.  I was quite disapointed in the flavor. If you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned (not refrigerated or fresh squeezed) OJ you know there is a HUGE differance in flavor. The bad, almost rotting component is carried over into this soda. IT even carries a rather odd aftertaste. I was not able to finish the entire can.<br /><br />This may be a feature of the Orange flavor. Other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good. But I recommend skilling the orange version."
3,"I bought these along with several other Raggedy Ann & Andy hot cocoas.  The Beary Blue and Pink Hot Chocolate both came with dented cans. I'm not sure if they came from the seller that way or if this happened during the shipping process, but I decided to keep them anyway.  This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin. Kids seem to love that it turns blue once it touches the milk or water."
4,"This is a great product, very fresh and all meat, thank you for such a healthy food for cats who need so much more protein than dogs, no grain fillers-- cats love it!"
1,"The Switch is not a soda -- it's fruit juice with carbonation. Still, drinking it is very much like drinking a soda, but you get your Vitamin C. I found the balance of sweetness and carbonation to be good, although just a little more carbonation would give this an added zip.<br /><br />What I especially like about this product is that it is all natural and there is no high-fructose corn syrup in the drink. However, this is not a low-calorie beverage, and the 8.3 ounce can had more than 100 calories. If you are going to include this product in your diet, be aware of that. It is fruit juice -- and yes, it has the calories. But this is a food and not just empty soda calories.<br /><br />I gave this flavor 4 stars because I found the kiwi flavor somewhat lacking. It's not bad, I just think the apple juice was more noticeable, although the strawberry flavor came through nicely. A stronger kiwi-strawberry flavor would have gotten 5 stars.<br /><br />As for the can, I found the zip tab a little difficult to open because of the proximity of the ring to the edge of the can. But I'm a bit of a klutz; I have problems with potato chip bags. So take this caveat with a grain of salt. I think the manufacturer has found a good size for the cans, because you get just enough of the drink to feel like you've had a treat, but not so much that the calorie count is on overkill."
1,"The Amita Peach Nectar is a very tasty natural fruit drink that is loaded with sugar. So, if you are looking for an alternative to orange juice and can tolerate the calories, you might want to give this drink a try. Also, it makes a nice ingredient in mixed alcoholic beverages such as peach bellinis."
1,"The Switch Orange Tangerine presents  an alternative to ordinary soft drinks, offering one- hundred percent of what you want in a drink and zero percent of what you don't want; or so the manufacturer claims. This is a newer brand of beverage and it follows a trend toward healthier alternatives for every day foods and drinks- a trend that has been gaining steam as more and more individuals look for ways to improve their health.<br /><br />This beverage offers a taste that is refreshing, but slightly different than what I expected. Yes, you get to experience the taste of juicy oranges and tangerines, but there are other flavors present as well and I couldn't quite put my finger on these other flavors until I read the ingredients and discovered that The Switch Orange Tangerine is also made with apple and grape juices. The grape is barely noticeable, but the apple can be detected and it, along with added soy, is responsible for the interesting taste sensation that you experience in the aftertaste.<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine is billed as a health drink and it does, indeed, have many positive selling points in terms of composition and nutrition. There is no added sugar, no artificial colors, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. The beverage is also gluten- free and provides one- hundred percent of the USRDA for Vitamin C and twenty percent of the USRDA for Vitamin A. There is no fat and no protein, either. But there are thirty- four grams of sugars and a fairly high level of calories. Granted, these are natural sugars but thirty- four grams is still a large amount and it won't be acceptable to those on low carb diets.  And with almost seventeen calories per ounce, the caloric content is higher than that of most soft drinks.<br /><br />So, are there enough reasons to make the switch to The Switch Orange Tangerine? My answer is yes, due to both its good, refreshing taste and its better than average nutritional content. It isn't the greatest tasting orange beverage I have ever tried and it is more expensive than most other drinks, including regular orange juice. But it does have enough positive points to earn it a recommendation."
1,"There are a number of different Switch juice flavors.  I tried Kiwi Berry, and I did like it.  There's a whole lot more than Kiwi in this can though, and while they are all natural products (meaning, not man made, I guess) I counted 5 other things besides Kiwi in there, which some of the other reviewers also pointed out.  It is carbonated - which brings out the flavor a bit more, in my opinion. It was sweet, yet they say no sugars are ""added"" (however, the natural products in the concoction already have 33g of sugar in them, in the 8.3 fluid ounce aluminum pop-top can).  There is 135 calories and 34g of carbs in that can too.<br /><br />So, while the flavor is good and I liked the sensation as I drank it, the marketing of the can (tall and narrow, a pretty pink, labeled as 100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't), the can makes me feel like this product is calling out to me saying, ""buy me because I'm a ""premium"" product.""  Well, I'm sorry, that's not why I buy a juice product.  I think the term for this would be ""preppy"" but still, I did taste good."
3,"I have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. It has such a bad aftertaste that I checked the box to see if I ordered sugarfree by mistake! I will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this, dont buy this brand. Its downright awful!"
1,"Switch Kiwi Berry is a good tasting, lightly carbonated fruit beverage that offers the great taste of natural fruit juice without any preservatives or man- made chemicals. Switch blends fruit juice concentrates with just the right amount of carbonation for a balance that is refreshing without being too bubbly.<br /><br />Switch manufactures several different flavors of its beverages and kiwi berry is one of several fruit- flavored options. I tend to prefer the taste of citrus, but I love the taste of berries also, provided the blend is just right. Switch Kiwi Berry offers a very good- tasting blend that captures flavors like strawberry and kiwi, along with apple, grape, raspberry, and other natural flavors. The kiwi and the strawberry are most noticeable, but if you search, you will also realize there is a small amount of grape, apple, and other fruits to produce the right balance and right smoothness.<br /><br />Switch Kiwi Berry is great for those who are concerned about their health. This beverage is all natural, contains no preservatives, no added sugar, no corn syrup, no artificial colors, and no gluten. Of course, the fact that there is no added sugar doesn't mean that no sugar exists. There is actually a pretty significant number of grams of natural sugar in each serving, as well as a significant number of calories. These numbers will make Switch unacceptable to those on low carb diets.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, however, Switch Kiwi Berry is a very tasty beverage with lots of sweet berry taste, a full day's supply of vitamin C, and no preservatives. It offers all- natural composition with a taste that is sweet and satisfying and a carbonation level that is just enough to make it refreshing without going overboard."
0,Great organic Earl Grey tea. I used an automatic tea maker on the medium brew setting. The black tea had a nice smooth flavor with a gentle bergamot aftertaste. I highly recommend this loose tea.
1,"I have to agree with several other reviews here that state the ""The Switch Orange Tangerine"" is too sweet on it's own. I ended up making a cool summer drink out of the can that I tried - served over ice & mixed with soda water. It was fantastic! The soda water/ice mixture helps cut down on the sweetness and improves on the refreshment factor.<br /><br />A little more about ""The Switch""... The can claims that this product is 100% Carbonated Juice with ""No Sugar Added"" and ""No Preservatives"". One can is 8.3 fluid ounces and provides 140 Calories. Total Sugars per can are 34g; 36g of carbs. One can provides 100% of the daily recommended dose of Vitamin C.<br /><br />That being said, I can't see myself drinking ""The Switch"" everyday. Even without preservatives and added sugars this drink still packs in a lot of sugar in every can. Though to be fair, I rarely drink soda or sweetened carbonated beverages. Still, for a nice alternative to the standard soda I recommend ""The Swtich"". The Tangerine flavor is reminiscent of Tang."
1,I like the sparking refreshing taste of Kiwi in combination with Strawberry but I probably would not sacrifice my thirst for the traditional diet free soda drinks that I got used to.

1,"I thought it had a bitter orange flavor, however my husband and friend liked it."
2,These pouches are so easy and convenient.  They taste great and are perfect for busy moms.
2,"My kid loves this stuff.  Since it comes 16 packages at a time, I have several packages leftover and now that he's almost 2, I still give it to my kid as a big appetizer while we order and wait for the food to come at restaurants.  He still loves it (despite being able to eat all sorts of ""regular"" food).  Much better than just loading up on tortilla chips at Mexican restaurants!"
2,"I have just found out today that the gelatin in this product is coming from pork. I do not know why they would add gelatin in the first place. DHA from fish oil is fine, but the lady that answered my phone told me that all DHA Gerber baby food items have pork gelatin. Do infants need gelatin at this age?"
0,"I was introduced to Runa guayusa about 6 months ago and I have been drinking it pretty consistently since then. It is a great alternative to coffee, which tends to make me nervous. The taste is mild and almost a little sweet, also it doesn't get bitter like green tea or yerba mate when steeped for too long.<br /><br />Also Runa's business model makes me feel good about drinking this tea, they are a certified B Corp and they do great work with the farmers in the Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend you try it!"
2,"Being an organic, health conscious family, we turned to Happy Baby for our food needs outside of the homemade foods we make.  Not only does my 8 month old literally beg for more with every bite, I can tell that her digestive system takes well to the hearty and top-of-the-line organic ingredients.  Happy Baby = Happy Mama!"
0,"I am very picky about the tea I drink my favorite being Ahmad English #1. After trying this tea, to my surprise and delight I may have found another favorite!<br /><br />This tea is very smooth with low acidity and it goes a long way. This is a loose tea and it brews up wonderfully in the Bodum double wall infuser cup. You can make several cups of tea with just a heaping teaspoon of this loose tea and each cup tastes great without being weak.<br /><br />The lemony bergomot is a lovely subtle addition that tastes and smells wonderful. The tea has a beautiful dark amber color and a full rounded flavor without the acidic bite some tea can have.<br /><br />At first the price seemed a bit high but after using it and seeing how little you actually need to use I would recommend this highly as a great value and consider it for gift giving. Then again once you try it you may not want to give it away. Very enjoyable tea!"
1,"I drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular orange/tangerine flavored soda, which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from 100% juice!  It has 140 calories and a great alternative to a regular soda.  I will definitely be purchasing these in the future!  I also tried their Kiwi Strawberry carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well."
0,I bought this tea at Stop and Shop and it clearly has warnings on it but I didn't expect it to cause like a panic attack or something uncomfortable like my heart to beat loudly as it was audible. I don't fancy the flavor of this tea.  Yogi makes a sampler with this one in it.
3,I tried this milk chocolate with hazelnuts for the first time recently after reading a review that this brand was the best chocolate in the world. I had to try it and it was worth every penny. I am a dark chocolate fan normally (70% is my favorite) but I have to say I would order this again and give it as a gift. It melted like butter in my mouth and was beyond delightful.
2,I love this product! I make all my own baby food and this makes the perfect portion size.  A bit pricy but worth it.
4,"This food is amazing.  When I got my dog she was being fed Canidae.  I saw how clean her coat was and how healthy she looked.  So I went and got the cat version.  My big cat has lost weight and looks the best he has in years.  My little kitten is as healthy as can be.  She is now gaining good amounts of weight, but not getting plump.  It is not like other cat foods that are like McDonalds for pets.  No sudden highs and lows after eating.  I thought pet food was just pet food, but I will never change this food for my pets. It is so amazing!!!  Give it a few weeks and you will see the same."
0,"I was looking forward to this tea, but unfortunately the mint overpowers the hibiscus and essentially makes this just another kind of mint tea.  I prefer the hibiscus tart be the star of the show in a hibiscus-based tea (aka ""herbal infusion"") and in my opinion, mint and ""tropical"" don't mix and now know going forward to pay more attention to the ingredients.  Still worth 3 stars because it can be a refreshing tea on a hot day, but just not a great tropical/hibiscus tea."
1,"I ordered this product because I have enjoyed Crystal Light since it first came on the scene. I was really looking forward to enjoying all the packettes of drink. I have high blood pressure and imagine my dismay when I discovered the Strawberry (which I was very much anticipating) was an ""energy"" drink with caffiene added. I had always relied upon Crystal Light because I did not have to worry about getting ingredients which would be harmful to my health, however if I had not noticed the caffiene in the packettes and drank them my blood pressure would have shot up and I could have had ill effects from it. I threw all the Strawberry packettes in the trash so I did not feel I got the value that I paid for because in the discription there was nothing about caffiene."
0,"With English parents, I grew up drinking many many pots of tea. I used to hold Earl Grey as may favourite until I stumbled across Lady Grey.  If you enjoy Earl Grey you will love this tea.  The aroma is magnificent and the flavour excellent.  It is smoother that Earl Grey and even when over brewed lacks the acidity and overpowering tannins that darker blacks can produce.  The nose of the tea greatly enhances the drinking experience.  Don't miss out on a possible favourite!"
0,I wish I had read the product description better....I didn;t realize this was sweetened...I do not like the sweetened teas...now I am stuck with 2 orders of them....but the other green tea powder is great.
0,This package was great.  My family are huge tea drinkers.  This gives an assortment of teas all of them are full of taste
1,Perfect size can and a refreshing drink. I think it's proof that simple is best. This would be my first choice for a drink if I were out and about.
0,I am a little dis appointed with this tea --  This was my first experience with loose tea --  initially this was good loose tea ---  after having tried for several months  -- I am dis appointed -- first it is a weak tea  --  I have tried brewing it  for long time changing my water settings and brew times and I keep getting same result  a weak tea  -- the amt of tea --  I just never seem to get the right mix  --

0,"My brother Robert that he has purchased this exact product in this size from local Indian grocers in Houston TX and in Austin Tx area, including one purchase at a WalMart store in an area with significant Indian populations.  The tea was reported to be a wonderful product for iced tea with a faint pleasant flowery aftertaste.  He will purchase it again and again"
0,"Love PG Tips tea.  It's hard to find in the USA, but a standard in the UK."
3,"Since I am willing to try alot of new things. I thought that I would buy this product.. And since I do like hot cocoa, I bought 2 boxes.. WORST thing I could have done.. This is bland, with very little flavour. It also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug.<br />Personally I will not buy this product again. I will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the Keurig K-Cup"

0,"This is a high quality tea.  When you first open the can, the Bergamot scent will floor you - it is strong, but not in a bad way, it is beautifully citrus filled.  The tea leaves are the nicest I have seen in a packaged tea (not from a specialty tea store I mean).  No fragments or breakage, just nice, clean full leaves.<br /><br />Brews up just as nice as it looks, very smooth flavor, no bitterness at all.<br /><br />I recommend giving this a try if you are looking for a new tea brand, it will not disappoint!"
3,We had previously tried another brand of hot coca k-cups. We bought these since they seemed to be a pretty good value. We actually like the taste and flavor of these more than the other brand we tried. They have just the right amount of cocoa and sweetness. We like the variety of flavors in the pack also.
1,"I bought this kit after I really enjoyed making the tropical riesling from the same manufacturer.  It was equally easy to make, but it is very peary.  I wouldn't have minded it if it was more subtle.  Still very drinkable, but I suspect that I'll be mixing it more."
1,"Overly sweet w/ a slight fizzy touch on the tongue. My husband and 4 year old appeared to like it, but overall I could barely take a couple of gulps.<br /><br />It reminded me too much like candy.<br /><br />I would not recommend this item personally, but some may find the drink enjoyable w/ the combination of juice and carbonate."
0,"My 22-year old son introduced us to this tea, which is quite refreshing. This powdered version has several virtues over the prepared version. It is much less expensive. It keeps much longer. My son says the taste is equal to or better than the prepared version (he makes it a bit stronger), and I like being able to make it a little weaker and less sweet. It mixes very easily with no powder remaining."
4,"I tried Tiki Cat Variety Pack and the only one my cats really ate well was the Bora Bora Sardine Cutlets in Lobster Consomme. Maybe one other flavor, I think the one with crab, they sorta ate, but definitely this one. So, I ordered a couple packs of 12 small cans. I feed them 1 can per day along with their dry food. They also like Weruva canned cat food and a new one called Addiction canned cat food which so far they love all the flavors I got them. My one skinny cat is super crazy over the Lobster Consomme part, but both cats eat it all. Nutritionally, sardines are really high in RNA which is a building block and RNA also contains the sugar ribose."
2,"My six month old baby loves the Earth's Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner - it's his favorite. He seems to love all the Earth's Best 2nd foods - fruits, vegetables, and dinners. The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat - not too thick, not too thin."
0,This is my husband's new favorite tea! I'm not huge on hibiscus but this does taste good. I'm sure we'll be buying more.
1,"I'm always looking for a carbonated alternative to sodas so I thought I'd give this a try. Generally I enjoy drinking naturally flavored sparkling water like La Croix or Crystal Geyser. I also very much enjoy Izzy's sparkling water/juice blends. Unlike Izzy, which combines juice and water, this is a 100% juice beverage that is carbonated. I have to say, it is definitely full of flavor, but it's just too sweet tasting. I like a bit of orange juice now and then, but for this type of carbonated drink, I'm just not into all that sweetness. I tried diluting it with some sparkling water, but the flavor just wasn't quite what I wanted. I like that Izzy is just a bit on the tart side with it's flavors. This is a nice idea and it's pretty ok. I just prefer other beverages over this one."
2,"My son is only 9mo, so he can't say it yet, but he LOVES these.  He gets excited when I even take them out of the pantry!! I like the fact that they are organic and also have carrots."
0,"As a person who love cinnamon scent and flavor, I find this tea amazing.  I was used to drinking the plain black tea at work and this blend is a nice change from that.  I can probably only have one or two cups a day because it is pretty sweet but I will continue to drink it probably every day.  Enjoy"
0,"Although this is a very good tea and it does calm me down, anyone suffering from an immune deficiency or Candida should not drink this tea as it contains barley malt, which I did not realize until I had a bad reaction. Otherwise it is a great tea and does as advertised. Just watch the ingredients, I seemingly over looked the ""Other Ingredients"". Now I have to give the tea to house guests, it's so disappointing."
0,This is a blend of black teas.  Some are more mild than others.  It is a very good deal for the money.
1,"SANS root beer has &lt;1 carb and zero calories. I have been on the hunt for good soda without sugar, aspartame or sucralose for a long time. I tried Zevia and think that the SANS root beer is much better. No weird aftertaste and it's not heavy tasting, just light and refreshing. I actually finish the entire can and I never did that with Zevia. I highly recommend SANS root beer soda!"
0,"Stumbled onto this tea by accident, but GLAD I did! I'm now on my 4th tin. Sometimes I add just a drop of honey and very thin slice of lemon, and my Saturday mornings are HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY!<br />This is my first Amazon review, but I like the tea so much, I wanted to share how awesome it is!"
0,"I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas. I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste. It also has a natural sweetness.<br /><br />The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg), Organic Black Tea (600 mg), Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg), Proprietary blend (600 mg), plus some Ginseng (panax), Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, and Guarana. Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors.<br /><br />My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee. I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day. I'll be coming back to this one."
4,"Like many others on here, my cat was vomiting within minutes of eating these ""tasty"" treats. She really loves them, however they don't love her back. It took me about a week to put this product and my sick kitty together. Finally after a google search, I came across these reviews. I stopped giving her the treats and so far, my cat has been vomit free. Buyer beware, this might not happen with every cat, so it may be wise to start slow with this product to see how your pet will react and build up slowly. Back to her ""greenies"" I go!!"
0,"This is a basic, good green tea.  I use enough for a 4-cup batch, but use only water for 1-cup.  In this way, I can drink a condensed form of it at my work desk all day long.  This keeps me from sneaking into the coffee room and getting my caffeine only from coffee sources.  Not that this is bad (my company gets the best coffee in the world), but all too often there are high-calorie or high-salt snacks lurking in the coffee room, just waiting for you to bounce in there!  Yikes!!  And you always fall for it:  I don't care who you are or how steeled your thoughts are against taking any ""free"" coffee-room snacks.<br /><br />Getting back to the tea.  This gunpowder green tea tastes great and it is entertaining too.  The ""gunpowder"" is rolled up little balls of tea leaves, and if you make this in clear glass you can watch them unroll (explode, like gunpowder).  This isn't the highest quality, but the price is right and it tastes good.  Perfect for your average normal day.  For that, I give it 5 stars."
1,"Sharp orange flavor with a tolerable spearmint taste. I've tried many of the less expensive brands and haven't liked any other except this one and Good Seasons Tuscany. I'm not crazy about all of the Tazo drinks, but this one is nice. I love drinking this tea with chocolate. It comes in an orange package. You can also smell the other spices. Don't make the mistake I make, by adding too much water. As with many products, amazon is over charging."
0,"This was my first experience of a bad Darjeeling - before, I hadn't known there was such a thing. The first brew yielded a dark rust color tinged with olive-green. The bottom of the cup was invisible. The taste was sharp and astringent. Thinking I'd brewed too long or too strong, I set the first cup aside and tried again. And then again. A light brew of 3 minutes improved the clarity; however, nothing I have tried since has removed a level of astringency and a furred taste that I associate with lesser teas. The wet leaves are the typical size, light brown but unexpectedly interspersed with limp green squares.  The aroma of dry tea in the bag reminds me of old hay - neither moldy nor spoiled, just old. In contrast, the Davidson's Keemun Conjou which arrived in the same shipment smells and tastes like delicious Keemun Conjou and nothing else.<br /><br />Given the price, I knew I was gamboling and consider this a lost bet. I have given the product two stars instead of one, because I haven't thrown it out (yet). I keep a supply of Lipton's bulk tea for emergencies such as long periods of unemployment, and I don't really need more emergency tea. Perhaps it will work for iced tea.<br /><br />By no means am I an expert, but I do value tea, and so I hope this opinion helps other buyers who are trying to decide between two Darjeelings. Davidson's ships quickly with value pricing, and so I am not giving up on the merchant. Just on this particular Darjeeling."
0,"Rishi's tea is great! Nice flavor, color and most importantly it is not super-caffeinated like many other Earl Grey teas, so one can enjoy a 'strong' brew. Their white tea is also fantastic. I only wish they would make an English Breakfast version."
0,"*****<br />Sweet African Green Rooibos Herbal Teasan is a delectable Numi tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and kosher and contains only green rooibos and honeybush. It is from South Africa, made from the same plant as Rooibos (Red Tea), but it is not sun-dried, and it has more anti-oxidants than green tea. It is also rich in phytoestrogens. It has a light, smooth, eathy-woody taste.<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi herbal teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you just want a tasty, high-quality rooibos tea, this one does not disappoint.<br />*****"
2,"This is a nice variety of flavors--two are meat-based (chicken and turkey) and two are vegetable-based (summer veggie and rice/lentil).  My 9-month-old daughter eats all these flavors and particularly likes the meat flavors.  I've had difficulty getting her to eat other meat foods, so I'm happy to have found two meat meals that she loves.  As with other Earth's Best varieties, these varieties include only organic ingredients without any of those funky preservatives."
2,"My 8 month old loves the food, especially the pumpkin (squash) and sweet potato.  I like it because it's easy to mix, organic, lightweight and environmentally friendly.  When she is older, I will use it in the other foods as well.  It tastes like ""real"" food, not ""baby food"".  It smells better too!"
0,"I live way out in the boondocks and even the closest little town stores do not carry Liptons' Loose Tea.  I don't want tea bags for both ecological and economical reasons, so the convenience of subscribing to a scheduled shipment at a reasonable price is wonderful for me.  Thank You."
0,"This is more than just a tea, drinking a cup is like a beautiful experience. It has a multi-dimensional flavor, it really does. I never considered myself a tea drinker, but I ordered it once at a Starbucks and was hooked ever since. On special occasions or even when I am down, I treat myself to a cup of this warm and delicous tea."
2,"I usually buy Sprout and thought I'd try this food since it got other great reviews.<br /><br />I am pleased with this meal.  It's a little less chunky than Sprout's stage 3 meals...so I worried a bit less about my baby gagging on it as he's learning to chew more.<br /><br />Also, the chicken, sweet potato is a big hit with my baby.  He ate it all up!<br /><br />These organic meals are a very nice alternative to making my own food for him."
1,"After the tasting of the ""Watermelon and Strawberry"" flavor I was pleasantly surprised at how good this one tasted. Imagine a carbonated juice that is 100% natural and is not overwhelming to the taste buds... this one is a real keeper! Light, Refreshing, and Great flavor keeps us coming for more!"
1,"There are no surprises here. The label promises a perfect blend between juice and carbonation, and that is exactly what Switch delivers: a drink that tastes like carbonated orange juice. Those looking for a healthier alternative to soda will like that Switch contains 100% juice with no added sugar or corn syrup. Those looking for a tasty new carbonated beverage probably won't be impressed.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, Amazon isn't yet stocking Switch so I can't offer an opinion on whether or not I think the price is fair. I wouldn't expect to pay much more than orange juice for this drink, though, since there's nothing really original going on inside the can."
1,"Orange Tangerine Switch is a crisp carbonated citrus beverage. Unlike its sugar-laden brethren, Switch doesn't leave a sticky film in your mouth after you've finished drinking it, presumably because there isn't any sugar added to the drink. My only complaint is the price: at about $1 per can, you don't get a whole lot of bang for your buck, especially since you can get a 12-oz can of regular soda for a much lower price.  I guess that's the price you pay for something that's ""better"" for you."
3,"I'm really baffled by the great differences of opinion on this product. I've tried a couple of different brands and the Grove Square was without doubt the best. I recently purchased a cup of hot cocoa at a local Joe Muggs (in a local BAM store) that was over $2  for the smallest size and really couldn't tell much difference. Obviously every person has different tastes and opinions but so many 1 and 5 star ratings for the exact same product? Oh well, I like it.<br />p.s. 11-27  I like this cocoa well enough that I have subscribed to momthly delivery with free shipping and reduced cost!"
0,The tea tin is guarding the aroma very well.<br />The taste is beautiful: the Malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just right.<br />The first time I used too much tea and soaked it for too long (I used as reference Darjeeling FTGFOP First Flush).<br />Since then I save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutes.<br />A delight: the best Earl Grey I ever had. The price is very competitive.
4,"Wonderful ingredients list but the peas are whole. If I don't mush them several of my cats just eat around them.<br />The cats & I all prefer the regular Felidae formula and it's a little cheaper, too."
1,Switch is a GREAT alternative to sodas for our family! Love them and I don't feel bad about the kids drinking them.  Great variety of flavors! I just wish they were more easily found in stores.
1,"First off, ordered 2 different types of these Switch drinks and they all literally have the same ingredients, albeit 1 or 2 slight differences. They both begin with : 'Filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates'... What? Not to mention, the first 2 main ingredients are apple and grape-both not the 'flavour' I ordered. Anyway, I rarely read labels to begin with, but for something supposedly 100% juice, I was curious...<br /><br />Ok, now for the taste, or lack thereof. It was slightly fizzy, nothing like full-blown soda, but jeez was it sweet. Like, nasty mediciny sweet. I could not finish the can. I couldn't even taste what flavour it was suppose to be. That's all there is to it. I am giving it 2 stars because it supposedly has 100% Vitamin C, which is a pretty much the only redeaming quality to this not juice but not soda type drink."
1,"On the plus side, they get the flavor and carbonation right here.  One fears a Tang taste, but it's more subtle than that and the bubbles are likewise discrete enough that it's no Fizzy-Lifting Drink.<br /><br />On the downside though, one would prefer a sharper after taste to the sort of syrupy way it stays on the tongue."
3,I have tried several types of hot chocolate since purchasing my Keurig and this is by far the one I enjoy the most.  I have it shipped every month so that I don't worry about running out!!!
1,"OK truth is, I do believe these help somewhat because I will be needing to go to the bathroom more and I WILL be sweating a lot more during my work outs.  But one flaw that it looks like some disagree with me on.  The taste is bloody awful!<br /><br />Let me say I am addicted to soda.... REALLY REALLY REALLY addicted to soda, so when these first came out a few years ago in cola, ginger ale and Lemon/lime i was quick to give these a try... The taste gave me nightmares, yes the taste actually gave me nightmares.  So after i finished the case i bought I was thinking i'd never drink them again.  But as of last year I got really serious with  my diet and remembered that these did indeed get me to sweat alot more, so i went ahead and ordered a 24 pack of these orange flavored ones.  Personally I think if you can stomach cola then your better off buying the cola flavor.  I hate cola flavor so I think this and Green Tea peach/Mango are the better ones.  They all taste awful to me and they give me a reason to keep going with my diet so i never have to consider drinking these again.<br /><br />So yeah they help, but the worst tasting drink ever in my opinion."
3,"Everyone in my family likes hot cocoa. I was running plain water through my k-cup maker and using hot cocoa from a canister but my kids didn't really get the right measurements and more often than not we would have overflow. So I decided to try this for my kids and it makes a perfect cup every time. No overflow. The taste is good, its creamy with enough cocoa to water ratio for my kids. I will be ordering this product from now on for my family.<br />In the interest of product comparison, we have ordered Timothy's white hot chocolate, and Green Mountain Hot cocoa, Timothy's was great, but pricy, and Green Mountain didn't really taste all that great to our family. It had a watered down taste to it."
3,"This is a much better Hot Chocolate than some of the reviews would have you believe.  My wife does NOT drink coffee (calls it ""Yuck"") and I am very particular about my coffee, BUT we agree that this is an absolutely delightful hot chocolate.  I use a medium cup size setting and it seems to be the best one for this brew.  This chocolate comes in as a not so close second to some of the great hot chocolates we have had while traveling Europe, however this did save us airfare. But this is not at all bad for an instant cup of pleasure.  Adding marshmallows or topping with whipped cream would take it over the top.<br /><br />If you are one of the ones who wants to throw yours away, please send my way.  I will get rid of them for you.  Thanks!)<br /><br />I got this product directly from Keurig as one of my two free when I registered my new brewer and purchased two.  Could not beat that price here, but at normal prices, this is the deal.<br /><br />From the package: 60 Calories, 2g fat, 11g Carbohydrate, 1g Fiber, 7 G sugar, 1g protein.  Ingredients: Sugar, Alkalized Cocoa powder, creamer (and all of those ingredients, etc."
4,"I used to work in a specialty pet store, and cats were my specialty. I was the expert on diet after spending much time researching various foods, reading labels, and talking to customers. I'll share what I learned, and explain why I recommend this food. Science Diet is one of the worst foods for cats, and right down at the bottom you'll also find Purina, Meow Mix, Eukanuba, and Iams. These have by-products, fillers (corn, soybean mill run, corn gluten, grits, or white rice).<br /><br />Many of the better foods like Blue Buffalo, Artemis, Wellness, Instinct, Orijen, California Naturals, Innova Evo, Merrick, and my personal favorite Vet's Choice Health Extension are world's apart in quality and most are cheaper than Science Diet pound for pound in many stores.<br /><br />These are the ingredients for a typical Science Diet bag minus the vitamins/minerals, just to give you an example:<br /><br />Ground Whole Grain Corn, Chicken By-Product Meal, Animal Fat, Dried Beet Pulp, Soybean Oil, Dried Egg Product, Flaxseed.<br /><br />Corn is a filler, and it's the number one ingredient. By products are things like beaks, feathers, etc. They're waste products. The only decent ingredients are down the ingredient list, meaning that they exist in a smaller amount then the first ingredients. Now, let's look at a bag of Health Extension that's both cheaper AND of higher quality:<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brown rice, Oats, Dried Egg Product, Chicken Fat, Flaxseed, Menhaden Fish Meal, Herring Oil, Sweet Potato, Cranberries, Blueberries, Tomato Pomace, Natural Barley Malt, Apple Cider Vinegar, Goji Berry, Garlic, Astragalus, Ginger, Blue Green Algae + 6 kinds of probiotics.<br /><br />The potato is a nice binder and good for digestion. The oils and flaxseed are good for the coat being rich in Omegs 3's. The probiotics regulate digestion. The eggs and chicken are good sources of protein. You might not *need* some of the extra ingredients like Goji berry for example, but they're better than fillers and at the very least harmless to cats.<br /><br />I recommend this food because my cats love it, it's relatively cheap for a quality food, and the ingredients are top-notch. If you want better food, go with Instinct (which my cats love even better, especially the rabbit) but be prepared to pay much more. The absolute best would be to put your cats on a raw diet using pucks of meat prepared by various companies, or simply do it yourself if you've researched how to prepare it, but this is an even more expensive route."
4,"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo."
0,"As others have mentioned, the taste is pretty bland. But it's cheap and if you put twice as much tea in it tastes almost as strong as fancier, more expensive brands. Almost."
1,"I've read that many people find this pop hard to find, but it's always been around in Minnesota! It's one of my favorites, next to Coka-Cola! It is very sweet, it tastes like a sweet carbonated fruit puch. You just have to try it!"
3,"Fantastic cocoa.  All the flavors are excellent but my personal favorite is the dark chocolate.  I received my Keurig as a Christmas present and I am loving cocoa at the end of the work day...no mixing, no microwave and positively no pot on the stove...just warm, chocolatey goodness on demand. Will order this product again"
1,This is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste.  I love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar.  It's more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst.  The size is perfect for times when you don't really want a 12 ounce drink.
2,"We love these. The cheddar carrot flavor is far better than the green flavor. My daughter, age 2, likes them both, but because we snack on them in the car I opt for the cheddar carrot which is tasty to me too. I love that they are healthy and I can feel great about giving her these instead of some brightly colored mystery things. Love em"
0,"I love this product. Tazo has produced a mild, yet sweet and spicy tea that I can only call magic. Sweet Cinnamon Spice has a flavor all on it's own, and I highly recommend it for adventurous spice tea drinkers looking for that perfect balance."
0,Love these tea biscuits. The price was great for a box of 12. I hope you continue to carry.
0,With all herbal treatments it is important to understand that the earlier in ilness one will start using them the better.<br />I love to use herbal teas and find them very effective when used properly.
4,My cats love this food. They always lick every last morsel of it. I love it too because it is one of the best values for a high-quality canned food.
3,I've had many hot cocoa K-Cups and I must say this one is the best by far. The Green Mountain one has a half & half bitter aftertaste while the grove square is very pleasant and is as close as you can get without actually using milk.
1,"I find this product to be too sweet and syrupy and consequently does not quench my thirst. The size is nice but that's the only thing I liked about it. This is a subjective review of course and other's may love this product, just not me."
0,"I received this tea today, a wet, chilly, dreary day with no promise but rain and sniffles; I immediately came home and opened it and got the hot pot going. The aroma that escaped upwards from the can was heavenly; delicate, alluring, definitely Earl Grey but with whispers of bergamot, a lemony, citrusy warmth that made me feel good immediately. I put aside all other endeavours for a time and gave myself up to a retreat with this wonderful light tea. Don't brew it more than 4 minutes; let the essence of the bergamot exude from the tea. Both your sense of taste and your sense of smell will be the better for having indulged in this tea. A lovely cap on a grey, ugly day.<br /><br />Rishi Earl Grey Tea is 100% Organic Fair Trade tea, grown by and harvested by the ethnic peoples of the Yunnan Province of China from tea trees planted in 696 A.D. By buying Fair Trade teas, the minority peoples who grow the tea benefit, through community developments and direct trade. The benefit to the purchaser is in knowing that they are doing a good thing for the earth and for the small farmer. I've just started seeing Fair Trade items coming onto the market, and I try to patronize the small farmer. You won't be cutting any corners by drinking this tea; it's truly a great beverage. It also says on the can that one serving can be used multiple times, so don't cavalierly throw it out after the first cup. Very recommended."
3,This is the best hot chocolate next to Cadbury bought in Europe.  Our 13 yr old would never drink her chocolate milk until we switched to this (unfortunately we don't have a steady supply of Cadbury's).  It's great!
0,"Brew it correctly and you really get a beautiful cup of tea.  I highly recommend this brand.  It is by far the best bagged green tea I have found, and I have tried about all of them.  I brew one bag in a 12 oz mug for 2 minutes.  Absolutely perfect."
0,"Well, KURT A. JOHNSON, on April 8, 2008, has said it best.  There is nothing he has written that is incorrect about this tea; HOWEVER, I enjoy adding just a bit of lemon to my Lady Grey tea.  BUT, you really don't need to add any lemon if you don't want to.<br /><br />THIS IS ONE OF THE  B-E-S-T  teas produced!  ENJOY!"
3,This hot chocolate is pretty blah. Not very chocolatey and certainly not very strong. It's not the fault of the Keurig -- the Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate is way better.
0,"Hands down my all time favorite iced tea. I typically prefer loose tea, but the taste of this tea is wonderful!  The pouches are so easy to use and make clean up a breeze."
4,I had been using this cat food for several months.  I had rescued a cat looking awfully skinny and dehydrated and as she began to fatten a little she quickly showed signs of pregnancy.  She gave birth a few weeks late to 6 kittens and I still have them all.  They have been fed nothing but Diamond once weaned and have beautiful coats and are very healthy and bouncy.  So thankful for Diamond.
2,"Don't let the ""Earth's Best"" name fool you .. as stated in multiple reviews here - CHECK THE INGREDIENTS!  No wonder so many positive reviews here have the same theme, ""My kids will only eat Earth's Best!"" .. Well that's because they are all SWEETENED, which is one of the worst things you can feed to your child regularly.  They WILL develop a sweet tooth QUICKLY, and will start rejecting pure vegetables / other good things because of this.  There is no need to inject applesauce or other sweeteners into other foods.  That's just shameful, and there is only one reason for it - so the child will eat it and only want this brand.<br /><br />Best advice - if you must buy pre-made food, be sure the ingredients are just the main ingredient(s) and (if needed) water.  That's it.  Don't buy a vegetable that has ""applesauce"" or another silly ingredient added just to make the child love it and want that brand because it's sweetened.<br /><br />Shame on Earth's Best as a company.  Kudos to their marketing department for creating a name whereas consumers will automatically be drawn to them because they think it's a great product based solely on the name."
1,"As the title says I'm not a fan of fizzy water and that taste definitely comes through in this drink. The 'tang' of this product assaults your mouth right from the first sip.  It smelled nice. But really it was just so sweet and carbonated that the experience was not enjoyable.  There no discernable taste of kiwi or strawberry, just a blast of sugar and bubbles. The 3 people under 11 in our familiy loved it but - as we knew they would.<br /><br />No thanks."
3,"Out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that I have tried this is by far the best one. Not weird aftertaste, and not watered down. Tastes amazing and priced fairly, what more could you ask for?"
3,"This like yummy homemade hot cocoa, with the benefit of being a delicious cup of coffee, too!  This is a GREAT deal!  Get it while it lasts!  Good to the last drop, you could say!<br />Enjoy!"
2,"My 18 month old likes them, but he will eat pretty much antying. My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon."
4,My cat had some major vomiting issues.  This food solved it instantly.  She seems to like it and seems to be in good health.
1,"While the taste of this ""carbonated juice"", as the manufacturer puts it, is good, there isn't much else to say for this beverage.  One can has 8.3 ounces, which is a bit less than most Americans are used to for a canned drink, but would be a good serving size for kids.  It does have 135 calories, which is a lot, when I could just drink a diet cola for either no calories or one calorie.  Sure, there would be a lot more unnatural additives, but this drink isn't even organic, which many others on the market are.  If I were to spend more money on a healthy and tasty beverage, this would not be my choice."
1,"Allow me to say that my situation may be different from yours. I have been a vegetarian since childhood and have perpetually experimented with all sorts of crazy foods -- so my pallet is accustom to more ""natural"" flavors.<br /><br />I have struggled for years to break my soda habit (besides the high-fructose corn syrup there are a number of other ingredients I'm simply not comfortable putting in my body). (And, Dr. Oz has been fairly forthcoming in saying that these products promote free radicals which hurry the aging process). Switch gave me the carbonation and sweet taste that I crave. No, it's not my favorite Mountain Dew ... but it's a good second-place and a wildly better choice.<br /><br />Some people are complaining about the calories (140 a can). For me (and maybe you), that's not a concern. What impresses me is that this drink is 100% juice. Why drink empty calories when you can fuel your body with goodness?<br /><br />Bottom-line: this product may surprise you! It has a pleasant flavor, is lightly carbonated, and crushed my desire for soda. I must admit, I am a fan!!"
4,"Annabelle (my three year old Persian mix) absolutely adores these. She does not like any other treats. These are perfect, because they're chewy, so they feel and taste different from her food. She does tricks for them and always comes running when we bring them out. Definitely try them. They are healthy (grain free) and perfect for any kitty! To the comment about the bag, just buy a treat jar. Works much better, and it looks cuter on your shelf or counter :)"
0,"Yes, there are higher HU products but this is exactly what is advertised.  I use this to make a tincture to reduce high blood pressure.  Comment if you want more info."
0,The quality of this tea is 5 star-it is in sealed bags. We're trying it out to see if helps our nails & skin.
1,This is very good but I prefer the liquid cherry juice.  Less messy to deal with and the concentrate doesn't seem to go as far as the liquid juice.  Just my preference.
2,"We love earth's best organic baby food, but this is not the tastiest one. I've tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. But my daughter still eats it, just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. It's got a decent amount of protein, which is important for us as a vegetarian family."
2,"My 17 yr old son loves these.  He eats the entire box of bars in two weeks.  Literally.  I like them too, but they rarely last long enough in the house for me to get one.  Chewy, just sweet enough, yum.  Kiddo is gluten free and refined sugar free and these are among his favorite snacks.  I love that they give Mr. 5% Body Fat with the metabolism of, well, a 17 year old boy, enough carbs to get through his school day (33g) in a form that is convenient enough for him to eat between classes.  Lunch alone is not enough, he has to eat between classes.  Yes, I know, if I could get some more protein into his snacks that would stick with him longer, but I also have to send what he will eat, and he eats these, whereas the other bars came back home.  Also, buying in bulk like this is a significantly better price than buying from the co-op."
1,"When these guys say all natural it really is and it tastes great!. I was pleasantly surprised by the stand-out flavor.  This is carbonated, I think it would be even better if is wasn't but this product's time has come.<br />I am fed up with the over-sweet juices with aftertaste that make it obvious they are not really natural. Switch this really gets my vote!"
1,"Energy Drinks are very popular these days.  Most, if not all, are loaded with sugar, various overloads of vitamins, and varying ""energy blends.""  A few energy drinks have tried adding pure juice, but have only come up with 50% at most.<br /><br />If your not a young'un and can't handle that blast of sugar and crash that follows, then Switch is a better alternative.  Switch is 100% juice, ZERO sugar, and lots of vitamin C.<br /><br />Switch is carbonated, so with the Orange Tangerine flavor, picture your morning juice with a little soda fizzle.  The taste is sweet, but not sugary.  Although the size of the can probably relates to the recommended serving, most people probably don't have this little juice in one sitting.<br /><br />Soda fizzle meets juice benefits.  It's a no brainer.  How about some more flavors?"
3,"This seems to be the best brand that I have tried.  Others have been very weak in flavor, but not htis one.  I would truly recommend this for Moms who have small children and need the hot chocolate after playing in the snow.  Grab the marshmellows and enjoy!  Grammie Smith (6 grandkids)"
0,"This is the quickest way to make a darn good cup of green tea!  I was skeptical about having a cup of tea that wasn't brewed, but this is very close!"
2,"I am in love with this product!!! Not only me, but also my 18-month old twin boys eat it almost everyday for breakfast. My parents, my niece, my sister and her boyfriend all love it as well.  So, as you can probably tell by now, this is really a delicious cereal. Also, I know that I'm eating something that is good,healthy and organic for me.  Usually I'll eat it with soymilk and some fruit, and it keeps me full and satisfied for a very long time. My household will never run out of it!  I hope that you always keep this product in stock, cause we can't live without it."
2,"I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didn't want my new baby to choke on.  I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething. It worked great for this, as well as for the food. I didn't like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean!"
1,"The Switch Orange Tangerine drink is one of the many beverages out there that are trying to offer soda drinkers a slightly healthier alternative without sacrificing the flavor.  No mistake should be made to think that Switch is primarily a fruit drink.  Although it contains 100% juice, Switch is a soda first and a fruit beverage second.  The carbonation, combined with the various citrus flavors, make Switch taste a bit like Mountain Dew with an extra orange kick.<br /><br />Soda fans who like Mountain Dew but want something made of juice should love Switch, as it does offer a slightly healthier alternative to the standard carbonated drink.  Since there are so many fruit juices present each can has 100% of the daily recommended Vitamin C and 20% of the daily recommended vitamin A.  The lack of artificial preservatives does also give it a slightly more crisp taste.<br /><br />It's important to note that Switch isn't ""sugar free,"" but rather has ""no sugar added.""  The distinction is missed by many, and could be very important for diabetics or anyone watching their sugar intake.  The drink actually has 34 grams of sugar in each can, but since it's coming from the fruit juice and not from high fructose corn syrup it's less of a problem for anyone looking for a more healthy drink.<br /><br />The biggest factor in deciding if Switch will be worthy anyone's time depends entirely on how much they enjoy carbonated citrus drinks.  Soda fans who want a fruitier and less artificial drink will probably love Switch.  People who just want fruit juice and don't enjoy the carbonated flavor should probably avoid, however."
2,This is very smooth and easy to feed to my triplets.  They love it.  I like that is has great vegetables in it also.
0,"when ordering in bulk with the repeat shipping option, this tasty tea is a great value"
0,"Hands down, by far the absolute worst tasting tea I have ever had.... and I have ALLOT! I am an avid tea drinker and I just can't get it down. The benefits are supposed to be amazing so I'll keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow it's bad. So strong too, tastes like dirt (*that's been pissed on in the woods)."
1,"A lovely pink drink...the packaging is very cute and inviting, so I was already enticed into wanting to enjoy the drink. And it's actually quite good! Always best when chilled...the mix of kiwis and strawberries is a unique combination, slightly sour then sweet.<br /><br />I like the carbonation, if it didn't have that it would just be a strange juice. I like that this is 100% juice and all natural, the fruit flavor is good without additional sugar or corn syrup...I would recommend giving it a try!"
2,"My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes fishy. Salmon is good for baby brain development. I tried to put butter or some seasoning to cover the fishy taste, but my son still does not want to eat it. He like other happy baby product like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and broccoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either."
4,"Now that the Pounce Hairball Treats are discontinued, I needed to find a new way of hiding treats for my cat's twice-daily medicine. I was hoping that these would be pliable enough to wrap around the very small pill. Unfortunately, they crumble whenever any pressure is applied. The cat adores them, but I have to be very careful when giving her her meds now, and make sure she eats the pill, not just the treat.<br /><br />Once these are gone, I'll be looking for something else."
1,I bought this juice because I really like mangoes. It is great refreshing and smooth beverage that everybody in our family enjoy. Will buy again.

4,"Just like anything else from New Zealand this food is amazing. My cat can't wait for it, and plate is always clean. She loves it and I feel great buying Ziwipeak. They even put green muscles in this food. Overall food looks solid, packed with proteins and kiwi love."
2,"I ate these, my older son ate these as a child and my younger son eats them.  They have been around for so many years.  We had not had them in awhile. They seem to have less sugar than when they originally came out, which is good. We love em here and will order again. They taste good and  are a little good for you too!"
2,We have always loved this snack.  Each time we seem to enjoy it a little bit more.  My daughter is a huge fan of it and is so glad that we can grab it and go.  It's a nutritious snack that satisfies all the tastebuds.  Some of us have even tried the slightly spicy brand.  Having both flavors allows us to satisfy those who like spicy and those who don't with the same snack...thus no arguments between the kids!
0,This tea is fantastic.  The main flavor is licorice - with other herbal undertones and it is my favorite tea of all.  I had to buy the six pack because I run through a single pack so fast.
2,"My daughter absolutely used to love the original version of the Chick Chick baby food (with Chicken, Sweet Potatoes, and Brown Rice). Unfortunately, the recipe has apparently just been updated (though not reflected on Amazon's page as of 2/24/2012) to include totally different ingredients (except for the chicken). Now my daughter absolutely refuses to eat this product. The consistency and flavor seem to have drastically changed. Hopefully your child will enjoy the new blend, but I wanted to provide a warning for those of you that may have tried the other version..."
1,"This was pretty tasty, but orange has never been my favorite. I recommend it if you like oranged flavored drinks. I absolutely love the strawberry kiwi. These drinks are not too sweet, natural and refreshing I will continue to try them. My beverage of choice is water and milk (and wine ;0) )...but for an ocassional treat drinks like these are great.<br />Try them."
1,"""No Sugar Added""<br />""No Preservatives""<br />""100% Juice Carbonated""<br />""All Natural""<br /><br />But it tastes just like soda . . .<br /><br />If you are a soda-lovers, but want a healthier alternative, this may be just the ticket. It's an especially great product for kids, because they really think they are getting soda, but without all the added sugars!"
2,"I love the thought that these baby foods are organic.  The shipping is quick, well packaged, and easy to open.  Baby likes ALL flavors so far of ANY type of Earth's Best baby food.  However, this brand is always more watery than any other brand I've tried."
4,"What self-respecting cat isn't a picky eater?  I've never met any.  My cat likes Whiskas Choice Cut foods mainly for the gravy, and sometimes for the meat.  Omar the Magnificent and Wonderful likes both  the Beef in Gravy or Tuna.  Truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go-to choice, but he's that way with all prepared moist foods.  If you ask him his true five-star preference is meat caught fresh in  the garden.  Let's skip the details, you don't want to know.... Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!<br /><br />I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container.  (Come on you all have cats that expect you to do this!)  Pouches are easy to dispose of too.  Just rinse and trash.  You aren't messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center."
4,I have 3 cats...2 could care less..the other one LOVES this so much.  I have it by their food bowls and she nibbles on it every day.  No throwing up like outside grass.
1,"So far this is the best cola flavoring I've found for those wanting to make their own cola.  It's got stevia in it, so it still doesn't taste 100% like coca cola, but it is SO MUCH BETTER than the nasty cola flavor that sodastream makes.  And hey - no artificial sweeteners is always good!<br /><br />It doesn't taste quite like cola, but it's close enough to make me happy and I liek it for it's own flavor."
1,"Cannot beat the price, imho. Less than one dollar per can. 100% fruit juice WITH carbonation. Each can has an estimate of 130 calories AND has 100% FDA of Vitamin C.<br /><br />What's not to love? My husband and I have been trying to find these sold locally. Until then, we'll get them here, from Amazon.<br /><br />This is one of the best (and tastiest) items I've ever reviewed. Kiwi Berry is the only flavor we have tried thus far. We look forward to trying most of the others."
3,My wife loves this item. She will not drink any other Hot Chocolate. The K-Cup system is great!
3,"I had high hopes for the convenience of this product.  My daughter LOVES hot chocolate. This really was a total disappointment.  I threw these kcups out.  If you use the smallest setting on your Keurig, you get 3 oz of watery hot chocolate.  Larger settings are not drinkable.<br /><br />Save your money and get cocoa packets or a good tin of hot cocoa - and take advantage of the instant hot water the keurig provides."
1,"Switch is a 100% natural carbonated fruit juice beverage. I like the way it tastes.  It's very sweet and a little tangy.  The ingredients are as follows: 100% juice from apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola, gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), soy.<br /><br />An 8.3 oz can has 140 calories, 36 grams of carbs,  100% daily requirement of vitamin C and not much else."
0,The tea tastes great hot or iced.  Very good for the price.  I recieved the package fast with no problems.
1,"These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry and Strawberry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). I was very happy and surprised to even see Kiwi and Strawberry listed. Even though the Strawberry is listed last. Each can has 135 calories, 15mg of sodium, 34g of carbohydrates, 33g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C.<br /><br />This sparkling juice did not have an identifiable taste of kiwi or strawberry. You could tell this was a mix of berries that blended the sweet with the tart for a refreshing drink. So it lives up to its name for it is called Kiwi Berry, not Kiwi Strawberry. So I was satisfied with its flavor. I liked the drink and would have more. But for my money I would rather by the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> brand of fortified sparkling juice that has a cleaner taste and fewer calories."
3,Stephen's Hot Chocolate is the best hot chocolate in the world I won't drink any other hot chocolate. The French Vanilla Is my personal favorite.
0,I ordered this because I LOVE bubble tea. I'll go crazy for it. The flavor is amazing and the bubbles were oook at times.
2,"This product is excellent.  Tried it one night for a quick, easy dinner and the whole family loved it, including my very fussy 19 year old daughter!  Well worth trying for yourself."
4,my cats favorite cat food he is very pickey and will not eat a lot of different cat foods but he loves this one
4,"My Sphynx cat loves the food but he has an allergic reaction to it. It makes him cough/choke intermittently over the course of a few days.  He has this same reaction when he drinks milk.  So, I will find some other cat to share the product with."
0,"Everyone who knows me knows that my favorite tea is Earl Grey. I've never had Rishi's Earl Grey, and now I'm asking where has it been all my life? This is one of the very best Earl Grey teas I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. It comes in a lovely container, and upon opening it, there is a wonderful fragrance of tea and orange bergamont. The quality of this tea is outstanding, and it makes a very invigorating cup of tea. I used one tablespoon and steeped it in boiling hot water for five minutes. I like my Earl Grey with a little milk and organic stevia (a natural sweetener), and honestly, I was in heaven sipping this. There are a lot of mediocre Earl Grey teas out there, but this one is truly top shelf. Don't hesitate to purchase this if you're a fan of this intoxicating tea!"
1,IMHO. There is simply not a better beverage on Earth. Since I need to add  some more words see prior sentence.
4,Used for less then 2 months both cats fur began falling out bad.<br />Stopped using it & the cats fur is back to fine.<br />Back to feeding my cats Nature's Variety instinct.<br />I baught this PetGaurd product at Fairway Market not Amazon.<br />Will not use it again.
0,"If you like the Ceylon tea variety, you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good (cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />NOTE: This listing's description is confusing. Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams, which equals 1.1 pounds or 17.6 ounces."
0,I use a little plastic shot glass to brew 2 liters perfectly at the office. We love it. That's only a few dry grams makes 2 liters of hot tea! Can't find this in my local supermarket. Glad Amazon has it!
0,"I ordered this for my father, who likes to use tea for his digestion. He's been very pleased with the flavor and the freshness. The packaging does an excellent job of preserving the tea, and our order has been refilled promptly."
1,"With all-natural ingredients and mostly real fruit juice, I'm not expecting this drink to taste like soda, punch, or anything like that, but I when I tasted it, I felt myself wanting more. I could really taste the orange-flavor coming though, but they somehow missed me on the tangerine side. Tangerines are very sweet, so I was expecting that to be the predominant flavor, but instead what I tasted was mostly orange, which left a somewhat sour/bitter aftertaste in my mouth. This drink wasn't bad, but given a choice, I'd rather drink orange juice or tangerine juice with seltzer. I don't see how this drink improves beyond that. Switch's other available flavors tasted much better, so in some ways this was a disappointment."
4,"I have 5 house cats.  One was recently diagnosed with diabetes.  We got his diabetes under control with insulin but I began researching diet information to help us.  All of my research led us to try Felidae grain free.  I spent two weeks carefully switching Louis (and the four girls) from dry Iams to Felidae.  I was immediately able to decrease his insulin and by the time I had him totally on Felidae we were able to discontinue insulin totally.  All with our veterinarian's supervision, a consistent feeding schedule and measured amounts. (It has not been effortless but it has been worthwhile.) Louis has been insulin free for two weeks now.  All five cats (ages 5 to 19) love the food.  Their stools are good, their coats look wonderful & they haven't vomited for weeks. YAY!"
0,I like Earl Grey tea as a change from black tea or green tea.  It has a very pleasant scent and taste to it that I find very relaxing.
0,"I ordered this Pack of 20 1-pound full leaf tea which looked like a great deal. Well....<br /><br />1st, it's not 20lbs of tea, I received only 1<br /><br />2nd, it's not high quality full leaf tea, but rather the ground tea leaves you'd expect from lipton<br /><br />Strangely enough, I ordered the non-decaf regular version and it arrived as full leaf tea and doesn't taste half bad. If someone receives something different than I or rather if someone receives what was advertised, I'd like to know about it. Maybe I'll try again."
1,Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste.  But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand
4,"I have been finding quality food for one of my kitties who has developed an allergy to chicken.  I hesitated on this brand because of the price, but then when I saw how limited my choices were I broke down and ordered a few of the flavors.  I have to say I am very pleased with the quality.  I also ordered some Evo venison and duck as well as the Natural Balance limited ingredients venison with peas and the duck with peas.  Neither of those COMPARE to this brand and my cats testify to that as well as I do.  The texture is so much better and she loves these the most.  I have gotten her the rabbit, duck and venison and she eats them all with more relish that either Evo or Natural Balance.  I do have to say that of those lesser brands, the Natural Balance venison does have a nice texture and not as ""pasty"" as the duck with peas.  Mabel wasn't as crazy about it though, although she did eat it all but not with the same excitement as the Instinct brand.  When you are having a problem with a cat that can not or will not eat something, when you find something she will, it is worth it's weight in gold!  This brand is a keeper."
4,"My cat loved this food for a long time. However, he has been picky lately. It's been harder and harder to get him to eat this, but the variety offered in this cat food is good and seemed to keep my cat healthy!"
0,"I found this tea 5 years ago, while staying at a Spa Resort in Washington.<br /><br />I absolutely love it! It's herbal, and helps me to relax with its very flavorful taste and color. Great for colds, as well as clearing the sinus. Soothing, beautiful, and delicious!<br /><br />I have ordered this tea every year, from Amazon.com, because the price is amazing, and well worth it. Likewise, I've given it to others as a gift, when I can afford to.<br /><br />This tea is wonderful with honey, sugar, sweetener, or just by itself! A must purchase for every household. Also great for on-the-road, for tea drinkers."
2,"My twin girls love this! I wanted to give them fish but wasn't ready to prepare it myself. These are perfect! I've tried Sprout pouch meals and didn't really like them, so I was a bit wary of these. But these pouches are easier to empty, and the texture is great for 10 month olds. My girls eat it right up."
0,We love this tea.  Its the only tea my coffee drinking hubby likes.  We use a single mug type tea strainer since the tea is very fine ground.
3,"While you would expect Ghiradelli to make good chocolate, the flavor of this mocha cocoa is precisely that of great darker chocolate flavor, using just enough coffee flavor to accent the cocoa without overtaking it.  A smooth, delicious start or finish to your day - even a warm afternoon pick me up on those chilly days!"
1,"If you like a little fizz with your juice this is a good product.  Tasty and refreshing.  However, like all juice it is not low in calories, so don't buy it expecting it to be more like a low cal fruit flavored sport drink."
0,"When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said ""natural"", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong ""mint"" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)"
0,"The orange and lemon peels make this tea very hippy.  Despite  the initial oohing and ahing over the pretty blue flowers, this is a regrettable purchase.  I was hoping for a stronger bergamot component than Twinings' Earl Grey but instead I got something that seems very herbal.  Blech.  I disagree with the positive reviews."
4,"This Cat food is very delicious that my cat loves the product. Every time I open the pouch, my cat will come wanting to eat it. Please try this product with your cat if you have not done so yet. It is good for cats that are picky eaters."
0,"There are a number of health benefits with cleansing teas. I was reading recently about how effective lemon was for cleansing as well, so I did a search and found this tea on Amazon.com. Tastes SOOOO much better than the traditional cleansing tea sold by this company. I would highly recommend as it is healthy, and tastes great with a little honey! Give it a shot, it is worth it."
0,"I have been purchasing this tea regularly for a couple of years through Amazon's subscribe and save program. I have never been disappointed with it's quality. I am not a tea snob nor connoisseur of fine teas, so I don't look for the finest tea or even know how it compares with other teas. All I want is an affordable tea that tastes very good to me. Any extra quality would be wasted on me, so why pay more.  This loose tea certainly fits the bill, plus it beats all the store brand tea bag teas and actually works out to be cheaper than most if not all."
0,Shipment arrived on time and in good condition.  Most retail stores don't even carry Lady Grey.  All I have found is the sample packs with maybe 2 or 3 bags of this delicious mix of tea.  It was truly a great deal for the price. Highly recommended!!
2,My 9 1/2 month old would mush this around in her mouth and not swallow it.  There isnt much she doesnt like but she sure doesnt like this stuff.  It looks like a weird mushy green stuff.  I am sure it is super healthy but she didnt like it at all.
0,"As others have commented, the bergamot scent is truly impressive in this tea.  The lovely metal tin indeed has two lids -- the usual one over the top, and then an inner, inset metal lid sealing the leaves in.  Opening it revealed a flood of sweet and citrus-y bergamot and a view of beautiful, large, dark teak leaves.  I brewed according to directions, and uploaded a photo above to show you the gorgeous amber tea and the huge leaves, nicely plumped from the hot water.  The tea was strongly scented with bergamot, yet I could still taste good clean black tea through it.  I highly recommend this tasty tea, which also happens to be organic and ""fair trade certified."""
1,"I tried Switch Orange Tangerine drink.  Excellent flavor and not so sweet as to make you feel you are getting a ton of sugar.  It has no added sugar and no corn sweetners, so, it is more natural than any other orange soda type drink.  More like a sparkling juice drink.  I have been a fan of orange juice and soda type drinks when as a kid I would mix OJ and Orange Soda.  Yet the natural taste of this drink is refreshing.  I tried it both with and without ice and although the iced version is more refreshing, if you get a very cold can of this drink it tasted very satisfying and did not leave you with an after taste or with the sugar blues.<br /><br />Caution, it has 34 grams of sugar, and although natural, you should check with a doc if you have sugar problems.  34 grams is equivalent to 5 or more teaspoons of sugar.  At least, if you like sparkling fruit drinks, check this one out.  I will next try it with added sparkling water to it.  Enjoy."
4,"We all know how picky cats can be.  It may be grain free, but food still smells, looks like, and fine details in label indicate ""highly processed"" with all the extra vitamins & minerals, which I think is the ""turnoff"" for the kitties. Doesn't say up front, but also contains New Zealand Green Mussell, which I am not sure how that ingredient fits in as I am not from New Zealand, but suspect locals rely on that for nutrients as we do mussells in this country.  They are spoiled on the real thing - minimally processed or raw rabbit, chicken, bird, wild caught salmon.  They will eat canned only if minimally processed.  Another cat food bites the dust but gives the dogs another treat! 1 STAR for not knowing about the New Zealand Mussell & for still being highly processed & therefore unpalatable as food for cats that love rabbit. 5 Star for a dog treat without the added hormones, grains, etc."
1,"When my daughter saw that I had a can of this to try out, she said, ""Oh, you have Switch!""  Apparently it's her school's answer to soda.<br /><br />I really liked this product.  It's a very small can, but for the same calorie content as a similar amount of soda, one can have a carbonated beverage that doesn't have added sugar and has some vitamin benefits as well (100% of vitamin C).<br /><br />It was not too sweet, and the flavor was not too strong.  Normally strawberry kiwi is NOT my favorite flavor combination, but I'm glad I tried it.  I would definitely try it again."
1,Great old time soda I drank as a kid that is no longer sold in Massachusetts. Was great to find it at a good price!
4,This comes in a case of 24 so I bought one can locally before ordering the large amount.  Good move!  I have 3 cats and none of them would eat it. This review is for the mature gourmet beef entree. Haven't tried the other favors yet.
4,"We switched over to this cat food a couple of months ago and my cats are very happy and healthy.  We have 2 indoor cats, 1 indoor/outdoor cat and feed 2 outdoor neighborhood cats, and they are all getting this cat food.  We were spending twice this amount on our indoor cats and feeding the outdoor neighborhood cats meow mix (we also have racoons dipping into the supply) but at this price we can eliminate storing 2 separate large bags of cat food and feed them all the same.<br /><br />The indoor cats love this food, plus they have stopped vomiting on the floor.  The cat box does not have a foul smell, either.  Our cats range from 8 lbs. to 25 lbs., and they all seem to be thriving.  Our extra small, elderly female has no problem with the kibble size and neither does our 25 lb extra large, slightly handicapped male (he had trauma to his head as a kitten - causing him to loose an eye, partial sinus and has had some mouth repair.  We do not know what happened to him, he had been operated on prior to our adopting him from our local animal rescue.)<br /><br />So, in my opinion, this food covers the entire scope of kitties' and their needs.  We are very thankful for finding this food :)"
4,I buy chicken livers for my cat. She has now learned to speak English persuasively in order to get these treats.(lol) They are economical and obviously well liked by my cat.
2,"We started our son on baby food a little after his 6 month birthday.  (he is almost 8 months now)  After introducing avocado and quinoa cereal, we tried NuturMe's squash, and it was a huge hit.  Same with the sweet potatoes, then the peas, then the apples.  I love that they are organic, they really do taste fresh and I much prefer to make it for him than give him jarred food.  I will often use a different spoon to mix it so I can lick some of it off, it tastes so good!  (the peas might be my favorite!)  Another reviewer was right, the peas end up being a bit grainy in texture; at first we just mixed it with a bit more water to make it smoother/more soupy, but now he eats it just fine at the 3 tbsp. of water mixture.  I just ordered some more as our stash was running out - a very sad thing!  I also want to try the ""froggy pasta"" recipe I saw on their blog.  I keep thinking of ways I want to use NurturMe after he's out of the puree stage.  I can't wait for them to introduce new flavors!"
4,"The vet recommended rabbit-based food for my cat, and that is difficult to find.  She seems to be allergic to chicken and the regular cat food menu.  Unfortunately, she's not crazy about this food, but that's just because she's a spoiled brat cat."
2,"My 6 month old baby absolutely loves this food, he smacks his slips every time I give it to him. Its so quick and easy to prepare I mix it with oatmeal or cereal and milk. Only downside is each package makes 2.5 oz, and its a bit pricey for me. But the quality of the food is superb! Its worth every penny! I don't use this daily since I make him his food, but this is a great substitute for on the go or last minute quick fix."
4,"This is my cat's favorite one.  He just licks that bowl clean whenever he gets it.  I usually buy a case of this one at a time and judging from how often it sells out, other cats must love it too.  The cheese hunks are large and look quite tasty.  It's just a very nice variety and something I'm sure every cat loves.  My previous cat about ran me down whenever I got it out to give to him and my current cat is no different.  Give this one a try - you'll be glad you did!"
2,"I was worried about it before I served it to my 12 month old... but after a tentative first session (there is a pretty strong salmon smell, and he seems opposed to strong scents), he's since eaten this package w/o problem, and finishes it every time!  We're pretty pleased with this meal - great texture and I feel good that he's getting some salmon in his diet.  We had one instance of diarrhea after eating this for lunch, but since it only happened once, I'm not 100% sure that it was because of the salmon package, but definitely I keep an eye for now.  It might have been one bad package in the stack... so it's still probably advisable to not serve this if you're going to be away from home :)."
4,"My cat LOVES Fancy Feast cat food; and this variety pack in particular makes mealtime a veritable newsworthy event! He always eats it down and he loves it; I can tell.<br /><br />You get eight cans of Ocean Whitefish & Tuna Feast; eight more cans of Savory Salmon Feast with Cod and eight more cans still of Sole & Shrimp Feast. Very good!<br /><br />The food does have some nutritional content; I always look for that when I buy food for the cat. There's some vitamin E, A, D3, B12, and B1. I like that. Naturally, ask your vet if you have any concerns about your cat's personal individual needs for nutritional content in their daily diet.<br /><br />If you catch a sale on this, stock up! However, I would use these cans of food within six months of buying them.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the better brands of cat food out there; and I recommend it. Your cat will love it and it has nutritional content which is great for them, too."
0,"I loved the Celestial Seasonings Earl Grey Decaf, but apparently it's discontinued and this has replaced it.  I don't like this nearly as much as the Celestial Seasonings.  Bah!  I feel betrayed."
2,"This is all my son will eat, besides oatmeal. The texture works for him, because he's always choking if things are too chunky. This has a mushy with texture consistency that he swallows just fine. I'm going to try other Happy baby products now.."
3,"I first tried it about seven years. Trader Joe's use to sell it in their stores and at the best price ever!  I am a hot cocoa fanatic AND I'm Mexican.  Per my qualifications, I say this is a great blend.  The ingredients are fresher than Abuelita and the sugar isn't as gritty.  I only wish I could find it wholesale.  Price is a bit steep at Amazon...<br />16 oz. (3-pack) - 34 cents/oz<br />14 oz. (4-pack) - 43 cents/oz.<br /><br />The 3-pack is the best deal (just over $1.00 per 8 oz. serving).  You can get 69 servings for $32.67.<br /><br />I have yet found a better prepared Mexican hot cocoa, seven years later."
0,"A very good English Breakfast tea--tastes great, even with milk.  The only down-side is that the leaves are small and they slip through the holes in my teapots."
1,"If you're a regular drinker of orange soda-pop, you might like this Switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage.  I thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated, not so fizzy that I had gas after drinking it.  At 140 calories per small serving, however, this isn't something I would regularly drink.  It's much healthier to eat whole fruit since it's more filling that simply drinking the extracted juice, in part because of the fiber associated with eating whole foods.  Still, this is a healthier option for those who regularly drink sugared sodas."
0,"I was just a bit underwhelmed by the flavor and aroma of this Earl Grey. I appreciate the fact that it is organic. That is always a major factor in my food purchases. The beautiful long leaves were impressive. I don't care for the fragrance of bergamot to dominate, I would say it was well balanced in this tea, but somehow the overall flavor was...nice.<br /><br />For this company and price, I expected an Ooh & Ahh moment upon inhaling the fragrance and taking the first sip. Their silver needle jasmine was exquisite.<br /><br />In a blind taste test, Twinnings humble tea bag would clobber it."
0,"I'm a big black tea drinker and have tried a lot of different brands out there, and I find that PG makes the best black tea. It's nice and strong, not like crappy Lipton black tea. We've been loyal to the PG brand black tea for over a year now - it's a little pricier than other brands, but definitely worth it if you enjoy black tea."
1,"Try it, it's great.  It has just a hint on carbonation and not enough to make me hiccup, which is what I do when the carbonation is too strong. The can is a little small for a meal but if you just want a sip or two it's great.  The flavor is the best but don't get the cherry."
2,"I wouldn't say my twins are picky eater, but they wouldn't eat this one.  They eat just about every Gerber's organics."
3,This does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use.I is just not good.
0,"Earl Grey tea is one of my favorite teas.  If it is important to you to have organic tea, seeing that it steeps in boiling water, then you cannot go wrong with this tea.  It has a rich fragrant smell as soon as you open the can.  No bags, so have a strainer or ball handy.  Recommended."
0,"The product is described as ""bold"" and that is accurate. We found that the high level of bergamot oil overwhelmed the flavor of the tea rather than enhancing it as other Earl Grey's we've tried. We are blending it with other teas to produce the milder bergamot we prefer."
0,"We are big fans of the Passion Fruit Tea but wanted to try something different. I like all of the flavors but the blackberry is my fave for a change of pace, still got to have the passion fruit as the go to tea though. Everyone raves about how good this stuff is. I can't make enough."
4,"Our Bischon Loves these treats, so does our cat! And we love that they have fresh fruits and veggies in them! Yeah!"
3,"I don't expect great hot chocolate from a k-cup, but it should at least taste like there's some cocoa in it. I can't believe how bad this stuff tastes. I tried it 3 times, and then threw the rest away."
2,"Ssssssssssssssh don't tell anybody!!!  More for me!  These are the best snacks ever and I am excited about them because my daughter plays softball and we have snack rotation... guess what they will be getting? Also for the kids little league, healthy, crunchy and satisfying, just what the little guys need!"
2,"I recommand this product. My childrens (5 and 3) love it, pouches as very usefull especially for breaks.<br />To choose. Enjoy"
1,"Switch is a decent soda, and definitely worth considering for those who want mainly natural ingredients. But I think it is overstating it a bit when the Switch can claims ""100 % of what you want and 0 % of what you don't want"" - or is soy something I would expect or want in a soda?<br /><br />For my personal taste, this Switch flavor (which was the only one I tried) was too sweet. It is hard to believe that there is no sugar added to that stuff.<br /><br />So - ok, but not great. I prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NU4VSO"">Izze Sparkling Pomegranate Soda 4 Pk (4-12 ounce bottles)</a> or any of the Izze flavors over Switch."
1,the perfect mixer for a summer vodka concoction or by itself for a sweet pick-me-up treat.  The sweetness isn't overpowering and the flavor it true to itself.  Perfect size for my kids to pick one up and have a sweet soda!
3,"All three tastes rich and chocolaty, not chalky at all. We were surprised how good they are, better than any other K-cup cocoa we've tried."
1,The fruit flavor was authentic but I found it a bit sweet.  It is what it says it is however; carbonated fruit juice.  It is a better alternative to soda if you like sweet carbonated drinks.
1,"Overall, I found Switch Kiwi Berry to be tasty.  I do think that perhaps they could dilute it a bit with more carbonated water, as the flavor seems pretty concentrated.  This would probably cut down on the calories and add to the company's bottom line too, as water is cheaper than fruit juice.<br /><br />I also think that the underlying apple juice flavor is bit too pronounced.  I'd like to taste a bit more of the berry and/or kiwi versus apple.  But it is nice to see a carbonated beverage that's made from natural ingredients.  Overall, I do recommend this product, although they could likely improve it with a few tweaks."
2,"My baby like this very much.I think the salmon is delicious,the salmon is good food,it can make my baby happy."
1,"The Switch Orange Tangerine sounded delicious when I ordered it. I thought it would be very refreshing on these hot summer days. And it would be if the taste were better. Perhaps the other flavors might be better but the orange tangerine had a bad aftertaste. Stick with the real juice if you want that flavor. The sparkling juice idea is good, I liked the carbonation as it was refreshing.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is the sugar. There was 34g of sugar in that little 8 oz. can. There is 40g in a 12 oz. can of Dr. Pepper. Way too much sugar.<br /><br />The other drawback for me is the price. I wouldn't buy it because it works out to be almost a dollar a can. If I'm going to pay that much, I would rather buy the regular juice (real, not reconstituted) in the store."
0,"I am in love with this tea. Every other apple cinnamon tea I've tried has been too cinnamon-y. This is the perfect blend. It tastes like apple cider without all the sugar, which I love. I recommend this tea to anyone who wants a low-cal version of apple cider."
0,"Twinings blend of Ceylon and Indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor. In non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness, brightness, strength and flavor. Normally I wouldn't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses, trucks, and stores for long periods of time. Yet Twinings seems to hold up well. I love tea, would drink 24/7 if possible, and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and Twinings is definetly one of them."
1,"I have been having blood sugar and yeast issues, and I've had to cut out sugar.  I had never tried sugar-free Kool-Aid before, so I was a bit nervous about this one.  Luckily I found the taste to be really good.  Even my picky kids love it!<br /><br />I love the fact that these come pre-sweetened in individual pouches.  You just tear one open and stir it into 2 quarts of water.  It couldn't be faster or easier!  It even dissolves well in cold water.<br /><br />I just ordered a case of the cherry flavor, too.  My kids and I can't get enough of the tropical punch flavor, so we're excited to try cherry, too."
0,"This is truly bad loose leaf tea.  I still haven't used very much of it and I bought it some time ago, and no it didn't go bad (unless it was shipped bad), as it was very subpar when I first got it.  Quite bitter and lacking any maltiness whatsoever (at best it tastes slightly above Lipton bagged tea).  Do yourself a favor and order from teasource.com or uptonteas.com both are far better then this.  Heck even Teavanna is better than this.  Extremely disappointing....can barely make passable sun tea out of it."
0,"This is my wife's absolute favorite Earl Grey.  Me, I find that while the Bergamot flavor is nice, I like a tea base that is a bit brisker."
0,"I drink this tea plain (without sugar or milk), and it has a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store.  One reviewer is right, I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma.  So the label ""Imperial Blend"" kind of implied the herb.<br /><br />I am not exactly a black tea drinker, so this tea is a surprise, and affordable too.  I usually prefer White Chinese tea, like White Peony, but it is more expensive, and requires lower temperature water.  But this is black tea, and this aroma kind of remind me the 'softness' of white tea."
0,"Assam is my favorite type of tea, but I was not happy with this particular brand. It is much weaker than other assam teas I've tried, and seems to have no flavor no matter how strongly I brew it."
1,"This seems like a pretty straightforward drink. It's coconut juice and it's pineapple juice, with a bit of sugar and not much else.<br /><br />They claim it's a good source of potassium and electrolytes.<br /><br />For me it was pretty tasty. Granted it was also very sweet. Is it a ""health drink""? I don't know if I'd go that far. It has Vitamin C and trace amounts of Calcium / Iron, but not much else other than sugar.<br /><br />For what it is (something sweet to sip), it's pretty good."
0,"I'm not that much of a tea drinker, so count this as a non-gourmet's review. When I first started drinking tea many years ago, it quickly became clear that loose tea was head and shoulders better than bags. I soon started getting foreign but garden variety loose teas from hole-in-the-wall ethnic food stores. Oh, and Constant Comment loose when I could find it (I know, I know). Last year a friend gave me a can of Rishi Earl Grey for Christmas. Wow. The flavor is everything other commenters have described. Plus, I now know why they call them tea ""leaves,"" not tea dust. :-) It still takes me a long time to go through a can--coffee is my preference--but I'll be ordering the three-pack soon from Amazon. One can will go back to the person who got me hooked on it, and a second can to a tea-drinker who I know will appreciate it, to spread the word. I'll keep the third can for myself, of course."
0,"I make my loose tea in a coffeemaker that has never been used for coffee, and I use unbleached filters to hold the tea.  The tea is fresh and so flavorful you wont believe it.  There is no dust in this tea as in teabags, just real tea.  I dont understand why loose tea isn't available everywhere, but I am glad to have found this source for it.  The price is very reasonable, especially when compared to other loose teas.  Do a Google search for loose tea and you will found out for yourself."
0,"Of all the Earl Grey's I've tried, this and Tazo's version are the most robust. If you like the distinctive flavor of bergamont, but wish it were more pronounced than in the conventional blend, and your not opposed to some extra tannins, then this or Tazo are your Earl Greys of choice. Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my favorite is Bigelow's. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. However, I have to knock Revolution by trying cut costs by not including a string with their tea bags. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception). Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version. Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves."
0,"Love that my favorites are all in one box. When company comes over, I can easily offer them a choice of some of the best teas out there."
4,"I really wanted my 2 yr old cat to like these treats because I already feed her Wellness wet food, which is excellent by itself. Perhaps she's too used to the Whiskas Temptations that I normally give her, but she did not like the jerky bits at all. I did notice it was hard for her to pick up because they're pretty flat, and the texture is chewier than what she's used to. The 3rd time I gave her the treats, she vomited it out. Looks like it's back to the less healthy alternative."
0,"Absolutely outstanding, if you like the aroma of Bergamot.  Despite the extemely strong aroma, the Bergamot flavor is not overwhelming (Taylor's aroma is milder, but its Bergamot flavor is completely overwhelming). Most Earl Grey is too subtile for me.<br /><br />Bergamot is probably a learned appreciation.  It is from citrus like a cross between an orange and a lime, with a powerful aroma and flavor of its own (inedible as fruit).<br /><br />You can still taste the tea, and it is great quality.  Add to this Fair Trade, Organic,and a great price, it can't be equaled.<br /><br />So if you like Bergamot aroma, and want enough Bergamot flavor to tell it's there, don't bother looking at anything else."
2,"I liked getting this one for my twin 10-month olds because it has such interesting ingredients, particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans.  I like the fact that it's vegetarian yet I believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice.  This list of ingredients looks excellent and it's a green color naturally.<br /><br />The babies liked it.  They have liked everything that has carrots.<br /><br />I have the subscription for this one as I really like the ingredients and the fact that I'm giving the babies food that is naturally green.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 8% protein, 40% vitamin A, 10% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 2% iron.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult."
0,"I like loose tea, I just don't like chewing on leaves in my tea cup, or having to dispose of a bunch of loose, soggy leaves that seem to find every corner of my kitchen. However, I'm spoiled rotten and only like the flavor that comes with brewing loose tea. So I've been using these empty tea bags in order to make loose tea a lot less messy and just as convenient as bagged tea. Most bags of this type I've encountered are made in Europe and come with a price to match, and a single pack of 100 doesn't last a whole long time.  When I saw this deal here on Amazon, I went for it.<br /><br />The bags look and work identically to the European made ones, although I believe these are made in India. (where they know a whole lot about making tea) But the price is about 2/3 less than that of the European made ones. I can't argue with that. (Well, I could argue with that, but I'm not a dope) That way, we can have the best tea on the market, which is sold loose, without the pain in the neck features of brewing loose tea with a tea ball or strainer. Just throw in the right amount of tea, tuck the top flap into the bag, and that's it. You now have a teabag of your favorite Kenyan Black tea (or whatever makes you happy) Throw away the neat little soggy bag when you're done - no mess at all.<br /><br />I've decided to get these on as a subscription, with a 6 pack arriving twice a year. That way, my family can have three cups or pots of tea each day (This size works for both), and maybe a few more on the weekend before running out. We've been using these bags for several months now, and are still as happy with them as we were when they arrived. If Amazon keeps offering these bags, I am sure we'll keep buying them!"
2,"While this is packaged well and convenient to open and pour out, it doesn't matter how easy it is<br />or how healthy if you can't get the baby to eat it! This is extremely blah, bland mush. I certainly<br />expected much better from this brand. In addition, since it's a stage 3 food, I expected there to be<br />pieces of meat and vegetables, however there's just a bunch of lightish brown mush my baby wont eat<br />even why I try to force it down her. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone despite it's health rating."
4,"And they never vomit. They wolf them down, thought I think they are crunching. They haven't TOTALLY stopped their occasional hairball hacking, but it is rare. Perhaps they would completely solve it if I could AFFORD to give them to them all the time. Only problem with this product is $$$. I would love to buy it in a larger bag . . . if they just made one. If your cat's don't like 'em move on, but definately worth a try if you want a treat that also helps with hairballs."
1,"Switch is a fun alternative to traditional soft drinks.  It's 100% juice and all natural; it contains no added sugar, no corn syrup, no preservatives and no artificial color.  What makes it fun is it's carbonated.  And just the right amount.<br /><br />The first sip is perhaps a little tart or bitter, but that's because most of us are used to soft drinks with added sugar, corn syrup and a bunch of largely unpronounceable chemical compounds.  Switch has none of that and, although different from traditional soft drinks, the taste is very refreshing.  The carbonation makes it a ""fun"" drink that you can feel good about consuming (it has 100% of the recommended allowance of vitamin C).<br /><br />Should Coke and Pepsi be worried?  Probably not, but it does taste good and it's actually good for you.  You should try it!"
0,I drink a lot of tea and this was a nice tea for a change. Lightly flavored and quite tasty.
1,"Boy, I really loved this drink.<br /><br />It tastes much like orange soda, only with no oddball aftertaste.  It's plenty sweet, but the sweetening is so naturally orangey that it doesn't seem overpowering like a coke can.  It's much smoother and easier to swallow than a conventional soda, with carbonation that is plenty strong, but not quite as strong as a can of Crush.<br /><br />It's a drink that is subtle not only in tone but in flavor.  You can taste the various other fruits mixed in with the tangerine and orange, but it's still very much an orange drink with no fruit punch aspirations.<br /><br />It tastes perfect, and there's no doubt that someone carefully went crazy saying 'too much!'  'not enough!' to every little facet of the drink before it was just right.<br /><br />No corn syrup or other bad additives.  At 36 carbs per 8.3 ounce serving, it's still got quite a lot of sugar in it.  If you're looking for an orange soda style drink that is really just carbonated juice, this is the best possible product I am quite sure."
0,"I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people."
0,I spent along time and a lot of money looking for a great Earl Grey... to this point its been loose leaf tea i order from another site until my girl friend went to London with her family bring me back a small sample pack of 10 tea bags. i loved it so much i had gotten this 6 pack of 20 count boxes which i have polished off and reordered since then.<br /><br />The tea stays fresh in the foil package each tea bag  which makes it so air and light cant damage the flavor of the tea which is the problem is loose leaf tea's.<br /><br />The flavor of the tea is a nice Bergamot flavor which is smooth no matter how long you leave the tea in. i perfer mine strong and straight up. each sit is as good as the first. i will keep buying this tea and also try other ones by ahmad of London
0,"I LOVE this tea. It is, hands down, my favorite.  And the ingredients are very ""clean"" and it's low calorie--especially compared to other teas out there.  This is the real deal.  It's basically like making it at home.<br /><br />It's SO yummy!  Light, refreshing.  I could drink it all day, by the gallon.  :)"
4,"I don't know why Science Diet is being referred to as junk food, as it is one of the higher quality foods on the market. A lot of the new organic and natural cat foods are not as healthy for pets as they are cracked up to be. But regardless, my veterinarian wanted me to put my 2 year old cat on a prescription food because of the high count of crystals in her urine. After some comparisons, Science Diet Mature Adult active longevity is the closest to the prescription food. Both my cats, the younger one and the older (10) are on this food and they seem to enjoy it. They both graze all day and are indoor cats so i try my best not to overfeed them. My younger cat has not had issues with her urine since she went on this food and we are all happy :)"
0,This is the best tea!!!! Just perfect warm or iced - my all time favorite!!!  The fragrance is wonderful - the taste even better!!!
1,This tangerine soda reminds me a lot of the drink called orangina but with a pronounced tangerine flavor.<br /> It is basically an all natural carbonated juice. It is very refreshing and pleasant tasting. Over all I like it a lot.
2,"My kids just absolutely LOVE these Buddy Fruits. They are easy to take along, don't bust open in the school bags.  They are nourishing and healthy but also fun and a cool snack.  They also don't make a mess with the lid and the thick pouch.  Great product!  Wish more stores would sell them in single packs and in boxes.  We also buy some of the other flavors they come in."
2,"First of all, I'd say that this product tastes more like sweet potato than chicken. The white lumpy stuff in the package tastes like brown rice pasta than chicken. So I am not where the chicken is cuz you can't taste it. But my daughter absolutely loves it. She gobbles down the whole thing in minutes (except her teething time).<br /><br />Although I am skeptical about the chicken part, I have to trust the labeling that says heavy amount of protein is in there.<br /><br />I also tried the turkey and chicken training meal from Plum brand. It has way too much spice in there. Not for my baby who is just starting out on protein. I will try the Plum brand a bit later. But you can definitely taste the meat in their products."
1,"In proportion this drink is about equal to a regular soda in calories and sugar content, but I would prefer a regular soda than this stuff. There is a slight citrus taste, but mainly from acidity and a horrible after taste of metal and sickly sweetness that lingers for several minutes after wards.<br /><br />Soda water with natural juice should be a refreshing, pleasant, and nice refreshment, but none of these traits are in this drink.<br /><br />I would be embarrassed to serve this beverage to anyone I liked for any occasion, but would consider giving it to people I really didn't care for to see their reaction.<br /><br />Avoid this one. Orange Crush or a different orange soda diluted with soda water would taste far better or soda water and regular orange juice would also be a treat that puts this nasty stuff to shame."
0,"I found this tea when I explored a local grocery store on the north shore of Oahu on a trip to Hawaii last summer. Every now & then I like to add cream to my tea so the idea of a milk tea wasn't totally bizarre. (How you'd guess I'm American?) I enjoy white, black, flavored & herbal teas but am not a fan of most floral blends.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect when the package said the ingredients included black tea, non-dairy creamer, rosehip extract & refined sugar. I've never considered putting non-dairy creamer into tea. Would it be a mess I dumped into the mug & stirred to death? Instead, I found all the ingredients in an oversized traditional paper tea bag held in a foil-like moisture proof package.<br /><br />After steeping ~3mins, I was thrilled to discover a light-flavored cup of tea, slightly fruity-scented, with a soothing feel to it and no floral tones to the taste. And no stirring, no clump at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />A year later I found one of the packages in my luggage & found it just as tasty & easy to prepare as last year. I went online to buy some more & was thrilled to find that Amazon offered the same item & a couple of other flavors by the same company too!"
0,"lots of uses for this green tea...<br /><br />I generally like most tea (though not the over-ally flowery blends)...<br /><br />Being on more of a health kick in recent years, I have added a lot more GREEN tea to my diet in one form or another...<br />from straight brewed tea &lt;> hot or iced...<br /><br />To adding the powder to things like salad dressings, smoothies, baked goods, etc.<br /><br />I am not new to green tea....as I first started drinking it when living in Japan some 30+ years ago....<br />in the ground form known as matcha.<br />A quality product. Dissolves well.<br /><br />I like both the unsweetened and the lightly sweetened."
2,"When my much older children were little, Gerber sold a sweet potato juice they loved! Go Vitamin A! Gerber has changed their offerings many times over the years giving this particular item ingredient and name changes. My daughter adjusts to the changes, but will prefer this juice over all others. And now when her friends come over, they leave telling their parents, ""I love carrot juice!"" Unfortunately fewer and fewer stores are caring the item as the Gerber line continues to change and update . I was so glad to find it still available on Amazon. Try it. I think you will be surprised and your own child's response."
3,"After drinking Swiss Miss watered down hot chocolates taste for so long, this is a very tasty creamy hot chocolate. My kids love it so I tried it and its the best I had in a while. I will be ordering more."
3,Once you try this piece of chocolate you will fall in love with it. Probably one of the best nonbar chocolates produced in Switzerland and Europe as a whole. And I think it is rather cheap for the quality you get.
4,Great dry cat food. Will definitely buy it again for my cat. He loved it and never got tired of it.
1,"The Switch in Kiwi Berry is a good tasting carbonated drink. It's fruity sweet with a bit of tang.<br /><br />We have made our own carbonated juice or punch drinks in the past using a home carbonating gadget. While it's not hard to do this, we can only make limited quantities and it's not very portable. But we love the results.<br /><br />The Switch took this same idea and packaged in their rather smallish cans. (Good size for kids, a bit too small for adults.) I'm still concerned with the sugar involved. At 35 grams a can, it still seems a bit much. But there is no caffeine, no added corn syrup, no added sugar, or other ingredients normally found in colas.<br /><br />But for what it is, The Switch soda is quite tasty. It's a great alternative to standard sodas out there. (Water is still best!)"
3,"I was very excited to get some hot chocolate cups for my Keurig and even happier there was a variety pack.  I read the reviews and even there were some negative ones, I went with it anyways.<br />I tried the milk chocolate.  It has such a weird taste to it.  But I gave it the benefit of the doubt and tried another later that night.  Same weird aftertaste.  I asked my husband to try it to make sure my taste buds weren't off. He commented that it had a ""hot plastic-y"" aftertaste to it.  Not even worth drinking.  Too bad I have 34 more cups that will go to waste."
2,"My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes sour. The taste of tomato is too strong. Tomato has lycopene, a antioxidant for good health, but my son just won't eat. He like other happy baby productx like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and broccoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either."
1,"With the new fad of making sodas that are good for you too, we have plenty to choose from in the drink isle. Switch's Orange Tangerine has a great taste, a fruity nose and is refreshing. But with the same calorie content [140] as a can of Coke - well, I'm sticking with Coke. Had Switch produced this product calorie-free like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00247D46E"">Nutrisoda Immune, Tangerine & Lime, 12Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> it would gain a greater market share with established soda drinkers. While Switch offers 100% RDA of vitamin C, the Nutrisodas pack on extras without padding our bodies."
3,"After trying many of the other hot cocoa k-cup options, I find that the Grove Square product tastes the best.  For my personal taste, I find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste.  Just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat.  However, this is not hot chocolate, which may be a turn off for some tasters."
0,I used to always go to Jamba Juice for the Match green tea shots...after trying this iced green tea powder I was hooked.  This flavor is lightly sweetend and the raspberry and pomegranate flavors are just subtle enough to not mask the true flavor of the green tea.  I don't mind the funny green color...after all it's green tea.
4,"Tuna, as is well documented, absorb and store Mercury in fat.  Anything that eats that fat consumes Mercury. I wouldn't feed tuna to a child, and I'd recommend any adult to read the literature regarding mercury content in seafood. How can it be safely fed to a cat? Regarding this brand of cat food, it's excellent as long as you feed chicken or turkey."
0,"Excellent Boldo tea. I have had Boldo tea many times in South America., and always wanted to get in the States. It was very difficult to obtain. This one surpasses what I had before, in flavor and body."
1,"I have tried and enjoyed The Switch black cherry flavor, but their kiwi-strawberry left a lot to be desired.  To my palate, the flavor seemed a mix of floral and medicine-y, not very pleasant.  I appreciate the fact that they are trying to push a healthy alternative to soda (basically carbonated water and fruit juice), but they need to get the flavor right."
2,I love the fact that there is turkey being offered. This is my son's 2nd favorite dish. No issues with it and a good balance of nutrients.
2,"OK - this is not great if you're trying to eat low-carb. The thing is sweetened with Agave, but it's still carbs.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad for a healthier snack. It will never beat a Ring-Ding, but it probably won't kill you as fast. One of my kids likes them, the other doesn't.<br /><br />I think they're OK. They have that weird aftertaste that all soft-bars, like Luna bars, seem to have. There could be a lot more coconut and chocolate for my taste.<br /><br />The nice thing about these puppies is that they are gluten-free for those who care. They are a good size to cram into a bag, though they'll crumble if you push them into a pocket."
0,"I was trying to tell my 91 year old auntie who lives in the desert near 29 Palms about ""Bubble tea""  She just didn't get it.  One day we were shopping in the other desert near Palm Springs and I saw a stand up sign for ""bubble tea"" at the food court.  We walked the entire length of the shopping mall so I could buy her a bubble tea, and the STAND WAS CLOSED !!  When I saw that Amazon (my favorite place) had bubble tea kits, I ordered one of each.  I sent the kits to my sister in Desert Hot Springs so she could make and take the bubble tea to Aunt Ruth.  Thank you for allowing me to fulfill another item on her bucket list !!"
3,"This is an OK hot cocoa. I had been using Land O'Lakes product, but wanted to try this for a change. The taste is comparable, but the portions in each packet is smaller. I still like Land O'Lakes hot cocoa better."
0,"This is a nice selection of decent quality teas.  It was a little heavy on Chai varieties for my taste, but I loved all of the other flavors."
0,"I guess the tin isn't totally airtight, since I could smell the tea and bergamot that adds up to Earl Grey. The cup of tea was even more fragrant, smooth and not bitter. Since it is loose tea, you need a tea strainer or tea ball, but since it is a small tin, you can pack it on a trip. I like it with milk, but others add lemon. Either way, it's what Earl Grey tea is supposed to taste like."
0,"I got tired of overpaying for tea at Teavana so decided to try this brand of Oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised. It has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer, I just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags. You just can't beat the value of this tea!"
3,"It's okay but it does not have a rich chocolatey taste. I actually find it to have a funky taste, can't quite figure it out."
2,"I have been looking for a great baby/ toddler snack that is simple, healthy, and GOOD!  These are it!!  I found them through a mommy blog and have been ordering then every month now!  My daughter started on them at about 8 months.  They soften and dissolve quickly in her mouth so no choking or much chewing.  She loves every flavor and they are GREAT for on the go.  100% Organic fruit without the mess involved with bringing along fresh fruit.  I don't have to worry about added chemicals, too much sugar, or other things found in baby/ toddler snacks.  Even I love them!!  Just make sure to close the bag because any moisture softens them up (still good, but they get sticky!)"
1,"This was actually a surprisingly refreshing drink that is lighter then OJ and reminds me of a virgin Mimosa. There was little after taste and the flavor isn't overbearing like an orange soda. The best thing is its all natural with no corn syrup. The bad thing is that the size is a little small at only 8.3 oz, which is probably to keep the calorie count down. Overall, a good, refreshing pick me up, but you may want to drink more then one."
4,"One star given just for possibility that some cats out there may be less (or different) picky from ours.  See my review of CAT-MAN-DOO BONITO SPRINKLES for info on several products I ""tested"" in search of a flavor/appetite enhancer, including this shrimp version and another F&S tuna treat product that was much better received by our gang of four."
3,This stuff is just awful. Doesn't taste like chocolate in the slightest. I've had very good Mexican spiced chocolate that actually tasted like chocolate. This stuff is just a mix of cinnamon and a bunch of other overpowering spices that are not pleasant. I can't believe this stuff has such good reviews. It's iky
0,"This tea is a nice change from my regular black tea. I'm not big on the taste of herbal teas so this was a good choice. It's closer to black but has it's own special taste, which I found myself looking forward to. Great in the evening as it doesn't contain caffeine."
0,"I bought this tea with great anticipation....gunpowder tea and mint sounded wonderful.  WELL!!  Look at that photo carefully.  This tea is unsweetened.  Ugh!  No where is there a written description regarding this.  Also, the mint is peppermint.  I figured it was going to be spearmint.  Finally, i thought gunpowder tea was a black tea.  This product is made with a green tea....leaving it with very little tea flavor.  Very strong peppermint flavor instead.  Guess that was my error in assumption on many things.  To me, not worth the money.  Bottles are smaller than expected and not one of the better made Tao products."
2,"My little girl can't get enough of this! I like that it is organic and contains fruit, veggies, protein and grains in one tasty meal. I wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars."
3,"We bought this to replace our Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa.  They are less expensive- but you get what you pay for.  This cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste.  I do not recommend it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q1T0"">Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups, Dark,Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>"
2,"I know these are super trendy right now, and I totally wanted to love this product (or, to be more exact, I wanted my toddler to love this product). He took one taste, handed it back to me, and said, ""Why you gave me baby food, mom?"" I tasted it, and he is right. It tastes just like jarred baby food. Same consistency (not any thicker), too. If your kid likes the packaging, great. If your kid doesn't, then it is just really, really expensive baby food. I'm going to give the rest to my baby, as the toddler is not the least bit interested."
1,Not only is the sweetener great in coffee or ice tea it makes a slammin skinny margarita.  Also try their Agava Simple Syrup - LOVE IT
0,"I recently purchased a large box of Taj Mahal tea through Amazon.com. The order was promptly shipped and received, was fresh, and met my expectations. Taj Mahal is a superior import tea from India and I highly recommend it."
1,I bought this in Montana on I90 at a gas station just to try ($.50-.99).  I believe this is the best soda out there.  If you can find it locally to save on shipping I would definitely give it a try and I will be looking for it locally also.<br /><br />I am from Wisconsin (a cherry state) and we have real (natural) cherry sodas.
2,"To be honest, my baby didn't really love all of these at first. He's pretty picky, so I had to mix fruit into some of these to get him interested in a few of them.  He took to the gourmet meals pack right away, but didn't love all of these.  But as he's gotten older, he's gotten less picky and seems to accept all of these flavors now without having to bribe him by mixing in fruit.  The prices on Amazon are good, so I will continue to order these here."
1,"This rootbeer is amazing. I love this soda. My husband loves this soda. My son loves this soda. If you are looking for a chemical-free diet soda, look no further. Seriously. This is a good soda."
2,My 10 month old can not get enough of this food.  We take this when we go out to eat and always have to take 2 packs because she loves it so much!!  Can't wait to try the other flavors.
0,"I have been trying different types of green tea to find one that is not too overpowering and where i can still reap the benefits of drinking green tea.  this one is it.  i put a packet of splenda in the equivalent of 2 1/2 cups of tea and even when i steep for up to 30 minutes (i get sidetracked when getting ready for work in the mornings) it is great, much more tolerable and less viscus than sencha.  i think i could even drink this one with no sweetener added."
0,"After a lifetime of tea drinking, I can honestly say that this is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted.  I have ordered it a number of times, and each batch is consistently excellent. I have even given it as a gift, as its container is superb for keeping loose tea fresh.  The metal canister has an inner lid that is lifted with its own attached knob, so the tea stays dry and fresh for the length of time it takes to use it up.  Do yourself a favor, if you like Earl Grey, and treat yourself to this tea."
4,"Note that I'm not recommending you feed your cat dog food on any kind of regular basis: the two types of animals generally need different kinds of foods and nutrients. However, at the time I was having trouble finding cat-specific dehydrated food that I thought my cats would tolerate, and this was the one dehydrated food I found that included a high amount of protein *and* specifically mentioned taurine on the label, which cats need, so I decided to use it temporarily. The cats absolutely adore it. I've since found a cat-specific flavor from the same company, but I'll probably use a little of this now and then as variety.<br /><br />The cats' coats look and feel shiny and healthy, and they definitely vomit less than when fed more mainstream foods. I also mixed it with some straight ground raw meat/organs/bone to make sure they were getting plenty of meat. The wild brushtail certainly seems to agree with them as a protein source, and there are precious few protein sources that don't make them sick (I'm limited to chicken, turkey, rabbit, and a small amount of fish usually). Because the brushtail is wild it isn't grain fed, and thus should have plenty of the right nutrients. Also, according to the company, it's an overpopulated nuisance pest, so this is a responsible way to help conserve the forests brushtail devour and the animals that live there. What's not to love?"
4,"My cat will go for a day, probably longer, haven't tryed it, but he'll walk right by this stuff every time, even when I know he's hungery. ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST. I swear he'd rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it!!"
1,"I was looking forward to tasting the Switch Orange Tangerine drink since orange and tangerine flavors are two of my favorite but I was disappointed in the result.<br /><br />It was tangy. It tasted of ascorbic acid. It smelled of orange candy. It reminded me of breakfast. It reminded me of, yes, powdered Tang mixed with carbonated water followed by a strong unpleasant artificial aftertaste.  I found the the drink to be, simply, not very good.<br /><br />I tried to like the beverage and I did appreciate the concept but considering the unusual flavors, high calorie count of 140 cals/8.5 oz, and cost of almost a dollar/serving -- I cannot recommend Switch."
0,"This blueberry and vanilla tea is excellent! I love all kinds of tea, and friend gave me some of this blueberry and vanilla (and a couple other Dilmah varieties).  They're all great, but this is one of my favorites.  The blueberry vanilla taste is delicious but not overpowering.  I usually add milk and sugar to my tea, but this one doesn't need it.  I highly recommend it!"
1,"A watered down perversion of the acai berry.<br /><br />This juice comes on strong and harsh.  With tart aftertaste and no texture.<br /><br />That's because it is mostly apple juice, grape juice, pomegranate juice, blackberry juice, blueberry juice, and tart cherry juice.  Oh yeah there is some acai berry juice mixed into this concoction.<br /><br />You shall not find that distinctive  smooth chocolaty acai flavor here.  There is no milky mouth pleasing texture neither.  For that exotic unique acai experience try Zola or Samzon  brands.<br /><br />I'm not saying that this Lakewood juice product isn't nutritious.  That's not my point.  I'm saying that it's a juice blend that does not taste anything like the real acai juice."
3,"I have never had any hot chocolate that tastes better than this. Not homemade, not from starbucks, not from Swissmiss... This is hands down the best I've ever had. I go through so much of this stuff because whenever friends come over, they go straight for it.<br /><br />But what happened to the price? Most k-cups run from about $0.45 - $0.65 but Amazon has these things going for $0.92. Even Bed Bath & Beyond has them cheaper than that. Bring the price back down to something reasonable and your 5-star review will return."
1,"I only received one can for testing instead of the 24 pack promised.  But I really have to say that this is truly a new and wonderful taste experience.  The taste of kiwi and berry juice is a very great mix, but carbonating it makes it irresistible.  It sure beats out cola drinks-both in nutrition and taste.<br /><br />100% fruit juice, no added sugar, no preservatives, carbonated: The only thing wrong with this product is that it comes in small (8.3 ounce) cans."
4,I bought this cat food at Tractor Supply. My cats hate this food. They won't eat it.<br />It is so hard my cat's have a hard time trying to eat it. My cats are very unhappy with this food. I would not buy again.
3,"I have tried several different types of sugar-free chocolates and this is one of the worst.  Instead, I recommend the Dove dark chocolate and the Russell Stover coconut."
2,"I know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores. I wasn't sure how many were in the package so I decided to just buy one.  There are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price, you are getting 16 containers.  I personally wasn't sure if I was getting a great price or paying slightly  more then if I went to the supermarket.  I like these gerber containers of baby food.  It's easier to get the food out, they do make some organic varieties, and you seem to get almost double the amount of food for the same price as jars.  If you only use half the lid snaps back on easy like a desposible food container."
0,"I bought this tea cause I had consumed the one from the bottle and I like that one.<br />However in tea bag is not just tasting totally and completely different, but additionally tastes really<br />horrible... believe me, I even tried to give it to my co workers for free after they tried it and they did not accept it.<br />In my opinion It tasted like Serum :s. Now I have 100 tea bags wasting space, probably soon they'll go to the waste bascket.<br /><br />It's sad... I thought it would taste like the bottle or at least close, but totally a disappointment."
1,"The kiwi/berry soda drink was tasty.  I enjoyed the light fruity flavor instead of the intensity and heaviness of the popular canned cola drinks.  The effervescence was perfect....again, not so intense as the other sodas.  The cans are small(only 8.3 oz.), but adequate for a small thirst.  The idea of healthy 100% fruit juices combined with a slight carbonation is fine for children and adults alike.  Probably the only downside is the price per can compared to those very popular, but ultra-sugary or fake sugar colas and other canned soft drinks....but, you getting a far better product."
1,"I liked just about all the Capri Suns up until a few years ago. For some odd reason (possibly because tons of people in the U.S. have a mild to severe problem with being overweight) they decided it was a good idea to subtract most of the sugar in these drinks and leave us with a near flavorless, almost diet-like drink to suit the kids better. Was this a good idea? Maybe health-wise yes, but not if you actually want to enjoy one of these. What the hell happened? These drinks used to be good! Now all I can say is that I will only reach into the fridge for one of these when there is nothing but water and cranberry juice available! They taste nearly as bad as the new and ""improved"" ""flavor-sucked-dry"" Huggie drinks. Yuck! Absolutely dreadful.<br /><br />2 (deserved) stars."
2,"I usually make my baby's food.... it's so easy, steam fruits & veggies and puree.... but sometimes I don't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth's Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn't like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn't eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn't recommend this flavor!"
4,"This food is working well for my 19 1/2 year-old-cat with kidney problems.  But I can't find any info on how many cans are included for this price?  I'm guessing 24 cans based on shipping weight and the price, but I won't buy without better info."
1,I am hooked.  This is a great way to get more fluids into my day without making it seem like a chore.  This powder tastes great without any additional sweeteners.  It is just what I have been looking for.  Also try the Blueberry version.  Delicious!
0,"Despite its reputation as the old standby variety of tea, Lipton compares favorably with other much more expensive brands.  Its loose tea packages are convenient to use and well-packaged for maintaining freshness during storage, shipment, and in the home, even after being opened.  All in all, a very superior product."
2,"First, the other happy baby flavors have been a hit with my baby and me.  But this mama grain is indescribable.  I knew it as soon as I opened the pouch...The smell is awful...But I figured we would try it anyway.  I only wish I had the video camera out...Baby didn't like this one at all and I can't blame him.  Recommend buying one pack regardless of the price before getting the 16 pack."
2,"My 10 month old twins LOVE these tiny dried fruits!  I love that they are organic!!  We've had the strawberry mix, the apple and the blueberry mix and they love all of them, but are particularly fond of the blueberries mixed in.  They pick out the blueberries before eating the rest.  These are freeze dried so they aren't gummy, but if you leave them out on a tray they will get gummier over time (maybe the moisture from the air?)  My twins didn't have a problem chewing them, but they've both had a lot of teeth for a while now.  One had 8 teeth at 7 months, the other had 6 teeth at the same time.  We started eating these at about 8 months old.  They have never choked on these (where they have with mum mum's and other types of crackers)"
1,"If you like tangerine and you think you need carbonation, then I think you'll like this product.  No sugar that I could taste to cut through the sourness of tangerine though there was a hint of the orange that helped take the edge off.  Of course if you really like tangerine, I mean you REALLY LIKE it, then you will get more than enough of it in this drink.<br /><br />We do need to be wary though of claims that natural equal healthy.  Is no sugar added really healthier?  What about the carbonate process that adds the fizzle and bubbles, what are those health affects if any?  Much like claims of organic we need to remember that not everything in nature is good for every person.  There is still a nice chunk of calories here, far more than water.  If you are allergic to citrus you shouldn't drink this even though you might drink things like Sunkisk.<br /><br />Did it taste good, oh yeah, it did to me because I like tangerine and orange.  But it did also have a slightly sour after taste that was annoying, easily solved with water.  Since I don't normally drink carbonated beverages though I felt a bit off after drinking this as well.<br /><br />This isn't just juice and you shouldn't make this a substitute for juice or fruit.  I don't doubt that it is slightly better for you thank other carbonated beverages though I think it would be better if they could cut some calories out as well."
0,Purchased this tea because of recommendation. Product arrived well packaged and quickly. I am very pleased with this product and will purchase it again.
3,"Best one in K cups todate not watery like several of the others I have tried. Will now join the subscribe and save group!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q64K"">Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups Variety Pack, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 12-Count (Pack of 3)</a>"
1,"I liked the level of carbonation.  It was actually more highly carbonated than I was expecting, but didn't taste dry the way I would expect an artificial-sugar-free drink to taste with carbonation added.  I was hoping it would taste more ""orangey,"" but the tangerine is the more dominant flavor (along with apple, a common juice ""filler"").  Despite having ""no added sugar,"" however, there is still 34 grams worth of it in the small 8.3oz can.  Basically, other than having 100% of the daily value of Vitamin C, this drink could easily be replaced with a better tasting orange soda that is in a 12oz can and costs far less.  Unless you really like the taste, or you want to ensure your Vitamin C beverage stays fresh longer, I'd give this one a pass."
0,"Hi, I have to have black tea everyday. I have done it in the past 25 years and it's a habit of mine. Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea. I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so :)"
0,"Not only does Tetley Tea come in cut little drawstring pouches, but it<br />is rich and tasty without being the least bit bitter. I enjoy all of<br />these flavors. What is better than sitting down with a nice cop of tea<br />and a book, I ask you?<br /><br />My daughter started sending me Tetley tea bags some time ago, and it<br />has been one of my favorites since."
0,"I've been drinking loose leaf tea for a while now and this has to be the worst stuff I have tried yet. I believe by ""Fine Tea"" they mean small particle size. My box is about the consistency of a box of dirt, instead of nice leaf parts. Following the directions did not produce a pleasant cup of tea. There is too much bitterness in this tea. I would definitely suggest checking out the Adagio teas. My Mother-in-Law gave me a sampler for Christmas and it had some excellent teas."
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry drink is good tasting and all natural.  It should be emphasized that it is full-strength juice, not a ""flavored water"" type product.  For that reason, I found it a bit strong because I am not accustomed to drinking much juice.  The carbonation does add a bit of lightness to it though.  I like that it didn't taste too artificial."
3,"I'm not much of a chocolate and peanut butter person, but these chocolates are the perfect combination of both.  The different flavors have definitely made me a fan."
2,Very surprised.  Expected it to be thicker.  My 8 month olds are not pickey eaters but they refused to close thier mouths while this food was is there.  I would try it from babies r us before buying in bulk here.
1,"To be blunt I'd call this Orangina (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000121BY6"">Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Pulp - 4 Glass Bottles</a>) sans pulp.  Basically the drink has minimal carbonation, and a light orange juice flavor with hints of rind/zest.  Undertones of grape and apple come across as well being that they are ingredients but I still feel this beverage is distinctly orange.  Compared to the cherry which I tried earlier I feel that this is a far more refreshing drink.  Personally I find this drink to be rather good and fans of Orangina should definitely take note."
0,It was neither fresh nor tasty.  Perhaps if they wrapped it in an airtight container it could change my opinion but by the time I got it it tasted as if it been lying around gathering dust.  The flavors of the tea didnt matter because they were overshadowed by the other factors. Had high hopes but had to toss it all out.
0,"I love this tea!  Both the green and white varieties are quite consistently fresh.  I have ordered this at least ten times from various internet sites.  I didn't realize how old and stale tea from the grocery store was until I had this brand.  For organic tea, it is quite reasonably priced.  They recommend using two tsp. of loose tea per cup.  I use half that and it tastes great.  Never, ever bitter!  Very smooth tasting.  I highly recommend!"
2,They have a funky flavour and really get all over you fingers. I bought these to eat while driving it it isn't going to work.
4,This is my cat's third favorite food.  It's great stuff - the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak slicked off for your friend.  My cat licks the bowl clean every time and wants more.  They should send me discounts for as much of this stuff I buy.  I buy it by the case if that gives you some idea!
0,This tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too.  Make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say.  It really seems to help you to feel better.
0,"Our acupuncturist recommended this to us,  to lower my cholesterol and to lower my husband's blood pressure.  So far so good.  We have been taking it for a little over a month, so in a few more months, we'll have a better idea of its effectiveness.  We take two capsules in the morning and two at night"
1,"I really enjoyed this drink!  I am a lover of both orange juice and sunkist type drinks so I was very eager to try this drink.  It is the perfect combination of sweet and fruity!!!  The tangerine I believe helps give the extra lift of the sweet taste.  If you're trying to cut back on pop, I highly recommend this drink or even just for a refreshing treat!"
0,"Good quality tea, and I like having a variety pack with the best flavors in one box. The price your pay on amazon.com is really great and beats supermarket by far."
0,I love Twinings Lady Grey but the most recent batch was pretty bad. Regardless of how I brew it I get an odd odor that masks the characteristic Lady Grey aroma. I used some older tea under exactly the same conditions and got a perfect cup. I've got 6 tins of this stuff and it is a lost cause.
0,"I first drank this tea at Naniboujou Lodge on the North Shore of Minnesota, and bought a small packet up there. I was hooked, so after I had drunk the first bit I bought I wanted to get more of this tea ASAP. Was glad to see it for sale in such a high quantity here. I used to be a coffee drinker, but I much prefer tea -- specifically, Ashbys Afternoon Tea -- now, and I just gave away a bag of coffee I'll never drink. I never quite got why British people are so into tea, but -- whether this is a typical British tea or not, I don't know -- I now see why they'd build their afternoons around a high-quality tea like this one. Sublime."
0,"This is a distinctive, different and very enjoyable tea. Fragrant and highly flavorful: it's almost liqueurlike, without any alcoholic side effects of course. Good on its own or with the usual suspect additives (milk, sugar and/or lemon). Try it at work: you'll convert your fellow galley slaves."
1,"This is a great tasting, no sugar, or other additives, alternative to soda pop. I love that it is carbonated juice only. We are used to Knudsen juice spritzers. This isn't quite as sweet as those. We love these."
0,I love this tea from Arizona tea hot or cold.  I call it my bubble gum tea.  This is a very pleasing tea that has a wonderful aroma and taste just like the Arizona tea in the bottles only hot.  It is very relaxing in the evening or invigorating in the morning or anytime for that matter.  I highly recommend it if you like Green Tea.
0,"This tea is what it is supposed to be, it is good, the packaging was good, and the tea is excellent"
1,The Switch Kiwi Berry is a nice refreshing alternative to the typical carbonated soft-drinks on the market.<br /><br />The taste although unusual at first is rather pleasant once you get used to it. I'd describe it as a cross between those Dole Blended juices and soda water. Strange as it sounds it actually tastes good.<br /><br />Although I suppose it's slightly better for you than soda - The Switch doesn't use High-Fructose Corn Syrup - it's still full of calories and carbs.<br /><br />Still for people who generally don't drink soda such as myself but find themselves occasionally craving a carbonated beverage this is a nice alternative.<br /><br />The can is only 8.3 oz. which does make it considerably smaller than a can of soda. As long as you can stick to only drinking one you'll be slightly better off than drinking a typical non-diet soda.
4,"Cats do occasionally need a little green in their diet.  Not a whole lot, but their typical ""prey"" in the wile would probably have vegetation in their stomachs when killed and eaten.  That being said, my kitties are weird and love to eat vegetables.  I have a toddler that likes to throw his food around so inevitably some ends up on the floor, and they are there to pounce when it falls!  The ingredients in this food are wholesome, my kitties eat this food whole peas and all, and it makes their coats wonderfully soft and silky.  This is not the only wet food I feed them, but it is one I do plan on keeping in their wet food rotation.  I give it my solid recommendation."
2,"These are very handy when fresh fruit isn't available.  I bought them for my 16 month old and I to enjoy, however they are a little too crunchy and sour for her to eat straight from the bag, maybe some of other the other dried ""just fruit"" varieties are less tart. Overall they are nice to have on hand, they lose some of their tartness when stirred in cereal or yogurt.  Also good for baking."
0,"Pros:<br />- Blown away from the intensive taste compared to Lipton brands<br />- Great smell<br />- Leafs are relatively large so they do not fall through and end up in your tea.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- STAINS anything and everything<br /><br />I never tried this type of tea, but WOW.  When you brew this tea my fiance and I actually said ""WHOA!"" out loud.  The leafs are perfect size and makes brewing it very easy.<br /><br />IMO I would classify this tea as a winter tea as when I drink it I just wish snow was falling and I am drinking my tea to warm up. :)<br /><br />I cant give it 5 star mainly because of how fast and dark this tea stains our cups.  You have to make sure you clean your cups right away or else this tea will stain, A LOT.  I accidentally spilled some tea on our floor, and it actually stained the floor :(  Of course this would be considered User Error and the draw back of using an actual organic good tea, but now I have to make sure I can find the cups that have already been stained so I dont stain any more.<br /><br />Overall: Get it. I will make sure I always have one in the house."
3,I buy Gosh That's Good Sugar Free White Velvet all of the time.  This is the best SF White Chocolate that I have ever used.  It may be a little expensive but it lasts a long time.  Buy it and ENJOY!
2,"I think BJs has a better deal on mixed fruit packs by Gerber, but if your child really loves peaches, this is great!"
1,"The only good thing was that it was not sweet, but the taste was just bad. I could understand and tolerate the taste if it was an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink.  I have been very open and have tried different carbonated orange drinks, and I have to say this is the least favorites of the 9 other carbonated orange drinks.  I prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice."
0,"This is by far the best Earl Grey tea ever. The bergamot is not overpowering, but pleasantly soothing. To me, organic tea is the best. It has no bitterness the way ""regular"" teas sometimes do. This is a very relaxing tea blend, a perfect way to start your morning. The price is more than reasonable, especially for organic tea. If you're an Earl Grey tea lover, you won't be disappointed."
0,A lot of tea for the price... ...no sweetener needed... The product works better than I expected it to. I also didn't realize how much I was ordering. I am enjoying this product. Has very good taste.
0,I love this organic raw honey!<br /><br />When using it in my tea I don't need a lot and the taste is great.<br /><br />Honey is also helpful with moisturizing and healing so other than consuming it I also use it on my hair and face often. The darker the better.
1,It is a little on the sweet side but does not taste like a strong vodka.  I usually enjoy it as a dessert drink. It is still a good strong vodka but the sweet flavor kills the alcohol taste resulting in a very smooth drink.  I usually mix it with a little bit of ice water and it is perfect!
2,I purchased the Turkey pouches because my 8 month old loved the Chick Chick.  This is nothing like the Chick Chick.  This looks like a dry paste and it smells bad too.  Currently I'm mixing them with a jar of the Earth's Best Organics 2oz veggie jar in order to give it some texture other than cat food.  This is absolutely nothing like the Chick Chick with is a hearty puree with actual pieces of chicken and pasta.  I would not recommend it.
1,"Everyone at my house, even my mother-in-law, enjoyed this drink.  It tastes very much like a quality soda, but is made with 100% real juice.  Small cans mean you don't consume a lot of calories at once, because although this is healthier than regular soda, you shouldn't drink too much -- it's still a lot of sugar."
1,"I get energy drink for our IT department and we've been trying out random ones off Amazon with free/prime shipping. Out of all of them thus far, this is by far the worst. The cola flavor was alright, a little too sweet, but not too disgusting, and it provided a great kick. This orange flavor we couldn't give away. It tastes like regurgitated orange juice with some artificial sweetener thrown in.<br /><br />If you tempted to try this energy drink, try a different flavor! Cola is super fake sweet tasting, but not bad, this one is repulsing."
1,This is not orange and tangerine juice; it's mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine. And I really don't care about the vitamin C content; vitamin C is easy to get.<br /><br />What I do care about is that this is definitely the worst-tasting soda of any type that I have ever tried. I couldn't pour it down the drain fast enough.
1,"I like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of Sunkist or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168A9KG"">Orange Crush Case 4-6pk</a> because they are so sickly sweet. This has just the right touch of natural sweetness, and the tangerine gives a nice little tang to the orange flavor. Reminds me of the great orange sodas you can get in Europe or specialty shops, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GN4OHK"">Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FQUCG"">San Pellegrino Aranciata 6 pack - 6oz bottles</a>.<br /><br />Dare I say it? Yes. The flavor and size make it a perfect mixer. After my intial sip, I immediately thought it would be great to fill up the rest of the glass with vodka."
0,"Since Republic of Tea discontinued their Bing Cherry Vanilla tea, I was looking for a replacement.  The flavor of this tea is very different from Republics - it's better.  The smell is very rich, like toasted vanilla and cherry.  It almost has a coffee smell, but not quite.  I don't like coffee, but this tea is incredible.  Glad I found it.  Best of all, the price!"
0,"As a long time tea drinker, was happy to come across this iced tea mix.  It serves as my sports drink while exercising or golfing.  I find this iced tea very refreshing.  I really like the flavor and especially the low sugar content.  The plain green is my favorite followed by the raspberry.  The blueberry is good too; it's unsweetened, so I add half a packet of Truvia."
3,For the price I think the cocoa cups are very good. I will order them again. They are nice to have in the house for the grand children and the holidays
1,"This carbonated 100% juice drink tastes incredibly good! You'll love this for yourself, for sport events, and for kids! These ought to be in every school vending machine (instead of sodas!)<br /><br />This is made from 100% juice, so great for adult (Or kids') lunches, picnics, etc. A great drink for exercise as well, and doesn't have the sugar in it, so no spikes in blood sugar... Likely a good choice for diabetics as well, and without the artificial sweeteners!<br /><br />I prefer the tangerine/orange version. This one is a little tart for me, but if you like tart, this one is for you!<br /><br />I would still prefer to drink this over any soda!"
2,"This is one of my son's favorite baby foods.  It does have a bit of sweetness, but not too sweet.  It's more runny than some of the other flavors, so we use a deeper spoon with this one, or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up."
0,Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea. Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste.
4,"Both of my cats (age 11) threw up for an extended period after eating just 3 of these. Into the trash they go (not the cats, the treats). Not sure what they were reacting to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk."
2,"If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend!"
2,My baby is 8 months and I purchased the gourmet meals pack. She really liked this one best out of all of them.
1,"I think this drink accomplishes what it sets out to... to taste like a sweet can of soda while delivering all the nutrition of its natural fruit juices.  Just while drinking one can it was easy to forget that this was a health drink and not an ordinary soda.<br /><br />I gave it only four stars because I had trouble digesting the mixed message that this product represents.  My mind is trained (maybe irreversibly) to associate this type of sweet carbonation with a junk beverage.  I didn't have that good mental feeling after drinking it that I do with juice, milk, water, etc.  I guess that's just my problem!"
0,"Very nice Tea.<br />I enjoy an Earl Grey that has a strong aroma and taste of Bergamot oil (the citrus flavor added)<br />Others are good, but this one is great."
4,"My young neutered male cat suffered a sudden and complete urinary blockage two years ago from struvite crystal formation, and spent almost a week in the hospital with a catheter inserted and frequent bladder flushing. Painful and life-threatening for the cat, and expensive and heart-breaking for me. He survived, and the vet put him on a prescription diet, but it was costly, hard to get, and worst of all the cat hated it. I tried the Pro Plan (with my vet's approval) and it's great! The cat loves it, and we have had no reoccurences of trouble (knock wood)! I also use the Pro Plan canned food for urinary tract health in conjunction with the dry food. Cat is healthy and happy. Highly recommended."
1,"I chuckled a little when I read that this soda had no added sugar when I checked the label in the can since it already has 34gms of sugar anything more added and you'll have sugar junkies of whoever tries the drink.  The soda is tasty and quite fizzy, I think it has more carbonation than Fanta which goes flat easier.  The can is the typical size of an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink merely another fruit flavored soda.  It is flavored naturally, but that is the only difference from regular soda type drinks."
1,"This is a mix of apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juices.<br /><br />Taste is obviously subjective and that can be seen in the reviews. I like the flavor but will try to describe it rather than raving or ranting about it.<br /><br />The tangerine is the dominant flavor. However it is the taste of a very ripe tangerine or, perhaps, a clementine. There is that slight alcohol or medicinal overtone to an otherwise good flavor. I could see people not liking it while other do.<br /><br />Each can has 34 grams of sugar, 100 vitamin C, and 20% vitamin A and not much else. These aren't nutrients that are otherwise hard to get so this isn't necessarily a healthy alternative to regular soda. On some level (e.g. producing fruit instead of sugar cane) it might be attractive to some."
2,"my son, who is six months old an a very avid eater of baby food (he generally eats whatever we put in his mouth with gusto) actually made an ""ick!"" face when i put the crisp apples mix in his mouth.  i think that's the first time i've ever seen him do that with a food.<br /><br />we tried both the crisp apples and the plump peas.  he ended up tolerating both (he definitely prefered the peas to the apples), but i tasted them myself, and, YUCK.  the plump peas taste like what they are...powdered.  they don't taste fresh at all.  the apples taste a bit better, but are kind of grainy and odd...and while i thought the sweet taste was OK, like i said, my son didn't seem to like it much at all.<br /><br />i wish we liked these better because i love the idea of a lightweight baby food that we could stash in our diaper bag that doesn't weigh much....too bad these aren't it."
3,"This is much too watery. It tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine.  After receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients,  I've decided not to order again.  This product if definitely not worth the money."
4,"Once or twice a year for a little variety and that's about enough for my cat of this particular variety.  He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he's had enough. He's not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Don't know why my cat doesn't like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it."
2,"From 6 month to 12 month, my son barely ate any solid food.  He was so picky.  We tried many different flavor from various brands and this was the only baby food that he'd actually finish the whole jar.  I didn't expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it, but I guessed it wrong.<br />Now he is 18 month old and he is a pretty healthy eater.  His current favorite seems to be tofu, but he still loves corn, zucchini, brown rice and carrot which are the ingredients of this.  I highly recommend to try this baby food.<br /><br />Also, Earth's Best makes not only the best baby foods but their toddler foods are fabulous as well.  My son doesn't really like any snacks from Gerber brand, but he likes most of the products from Earth's Best.  Their foods taste great(even for us adult) and so good for you too."
0,"This has been my favorite tea for more than a decade but I can't find it locally. I had been ordering directly from Twining but placed this order with Amazon because of the free shipping for orders over $25.00 which saves me at least $1.00 per tin. Saving a buck is always exciting to one of Scots descent and since I drink a pot every day, it can add up over time."
2,"We just got our first order a few days ago, and my 10 month old daughter loves them! They're just like the Gerber mini veggies, but much cheaper. Although they still cost a good bit, having a nutrient filled, easy to take anywhere travel snack is well worth it. My daughter doesn't have any teeth yet, and she hasn't had any problems eating them. They're light and fluffy, yet full of flavor."
2,"My 9 year old absolutely loves it!  Of course she is a fancy Nancy fan and whenever I sit down to have my Latte, she feels all grown up to have her fancy hot chocolate with her Mommy.  Love the taste and aromatic coconut scent.  I think its great she loves it and its different, she loves it and that is the most important thing she feels she now has her own special drink like Mommy when we cozy up to hot drink.  I have to find some more as she is upset she has ran out and we were lucky to find this one at Home Goods, now have to see where I can order some."
1,"I like this 'Orange Tangerine' more than the other two of these drinks I reviewed previously: it tastes probably the least sweet of all three, but still a little too sweet-carbonated for me.  It advertises 'no sugar added' and '100% juice carbonated' and 'no preservatives', so I was expecting some sweet ~ this drink tastes like carbonated, watered-down orange juice, but it's actually a pretty good flavor, and packs 140 calories, 34g sugar and 36g carbs in a 'no sugar added'-'no corn syrup'- 'no preservatives'-'no artificial colors'-'gluten free' drink!  I would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry, but I would also expect it to TASTE a bit more natural, and this one, like I said above, tastes like carbonated orange juice with tangerine ~ it's nice tasting, but too much in the way of calories & such for me to drink this very often.<br /><br />It was certainly good, but for the tastebuds of someone who WAS a lifelong soda drinker (diet soda for the past 12 years), and gave up soda a year ago(I very occasionally drink a carbonated beverage now) this is not the drink for me.  I mostly drink water, milk, iced tea, hot tea & coffee now, and this sweet tasting, sugary tasting beverage, had way too much carbonation & flavoring for me!  The orange tangerine flavors were nice but still TASTED fake, which is weird for a drink that touts things like '100% juice' and a label that says 'natural flavors'...I would recommend this product only to those who like somewhat sweet, fruitie carbonated beverages...enjoy!"
2,"Earth's Best is supposed to be one of the best baby foods, but apparently my son does not have a palate for their food.  Maybe he did not like the texture of this stuff (it looks gritty).  He normally eats anything but was very sluggish with this food...turning his head after a couple of bites."
1,"Switch Kiwi Berry is a soda made from carbonated water and juice concentrates of Apple, Grape, Kiwi, Acerola, Raspberry, Strawberry and mysterious ""natural flavors"". At 135 calories per can, it's slightly higher in carbs than an average soda.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because although it is refreshingly free of high fructose corn syrup, it claims to be ""all natural"" -- not sure what's natural about juice concentrate. And, like regular soda, it is chock full of ""empty"" carbs -- like eating raw sugar. I get the feeling from the packaging we're supposed to think it's a healthier alternative, and this seems disengenious at best.<br /><br />It tastes OK, but really isn't anything special; it doesn't taste like kiwi fruit and only vaguely of strawberries."
2,"My daughter (9 months) absolutely loves these ""snackin' fruit rings.""  And I feel much better feeding these to her because they are Earth's Best.  I much prefer this to the other brands puffs.  They do not melt like the other ones, but my daughter is fine with them.  She gets a big smile on her face when she sees me take them out and is trying to open the container to get them.  A great snack, and a great distraction in a restaurant.  I just wish I could buy them in a smaller bulk amount."
1,"This is a wonderful alternative to soda pop.  It's delicious, refreshing and most of all, natural.  I ordered the Tangerine/Orange.  I'm anxious to try the other flavors.  My only gripe is that the cans are rather small.  Other than that, it rocks!!"
0,No tea flavor at all. Just whole brunch of artifial flavors. It is not returnable. I wasted 20+ bucks.
0,"This Assam tea is delicious, and a good deal, especially for organic and fair trade. I will say that I expected it to have a bolder flavor, which I am used to with other Assam teas I have tried. It has the same flavor characteristics of other Assam teas - it just doesn't brew dark and strong even with a lot of leaves in the infuser. That said, I am enjoying this somewhat more delicate Assam tea a lot, and the price was right. The listing promises ""fair trade certified"" and ""certified organic"", but the label on the bag doesn't have any fair trade certification. Hopefully the advertising is correct."
0,"I first came across Lover's Leap Estate tea when buying it from Harney & Sons. I enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness, reminiscent of an Afternoon Darjeeling. The reason I went with the Elmwood Inn now was that Harney only sells this tea in tins and I wasn't interested in adding a tin to my collection every time I purchased this tea.<br /><br />Of course I cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but I must say that the Elmwood Inn fell short of my expectations. It tastes rather uninteresting and almost flat, and in order to get any kind of recognizable flavor, I have to use plenty of leaves. Yet it still never achieves any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over, lets say, loose Twinings for much less. I will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to Harney's Lover's Leap."
1,This Switch Kiwi Berry ought to be on the DEA's list of banned substances it is so good.  Every one of the 8.3 ounces had me smacking my lips trying to make it last longer.  A natural sweetness and ice cold out of my refrigerator was the way I tasted it the first (and sadly only) time.<br /><br />I just wish a grocer in West Virginia would start carrying it. C'mon Wal-Mart and/or Food Lion.  Get some of this stuff!
1,"I want to start this review by stating that this is not the perfect balance between juice and carbonated drink I've ever had.  That said this is certainly a good alternative for those who love carbonated drinks but don't like some of the ingredients.  Switch has attempted to address this concern and I feel it's a step in the right direct.  This is an Orange Tangerine flavored juice that is carbonated but without added sugar, preservatives, corn syrup, or caffeine.  In other words this is about as natural as you can get without, you know, drinking real orange juice.<br /><br />The can is also thinner then a soda can so you're not getting as much liquid as you would a Pepsi or Coke.  This means there is less fat in each can, and the makers claim the product is glutton free.  It does have a bit of a weird aftertaste, but after a few sips it stops bothering you.  While not a perfect drink it's one I enjoyed and will likely pick up again in the future."
0,I'm a big earl gray fan and I loved the deal and taste of this tea!  Will definitely keep my subscribe and save order  on this tea and recommend it.
1,"This carbonated juice drink quenched my thirst.  The small size means you don't have to commit to a huge serving and is a fantastic size for kids who never, ever seem to finish a can of anything.<br /><br />It is 100% juice and makes a very tasty refreshing way to get a serving of fruit for the day.<br />It also has 100% of the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin C and only 1% sodium.<br />I would absolutely offer this in place of soda for my children."
2,"Ok, sounds crazy i know but i heard about this baby food diet and figured whats there to loose. The food tastes good, and im sure your baby will like it too hahaha!"
1,"This has more calories than a regular coke. Even though it says 100% pure juice and no sugar/syrup added, it still tastes so sweet that I couldn't even finish one can.<br /><br />If this weren't so sugary tasting, I'd like it much more. Flavor-wise it's not bad, though. Maybe it's only fruit sugar and supposedly fruit sugar isn't as bad for the health, but still... way too sweet for something that's supposed to be ""healthy.""<br /><br />Maybe little kids would like it as a treat. Probably beats having candy."
1,"it' an okay drink and didn't have a harsh or oddly synthetic taste to it as some ""juice"" drinks have, yet it wasn't anything super.<br /><br />This is a nice alternative to regular soda, but I don't see myself buying it that often. The high carbonation makes it less healthy than it is touted and is bad for your stomach. Too bad they didn't make it less carbonated or perhaps a non-carbonated version."
3,"the greatest, best chocolate taste in any keurig k-cups out there. will definitely order more. everyone in the office tries to steal them. i'm a chocolate nut, and these pass the test."
4,"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!"
0,"Buy it now, please. These are just great, with perfect flavor and texture. I keep them in the refer where they are even more refreshing. Try them with different things: in salads, with crudite, with good dark chocolate, with your tea in the morning, as we do. A+++"
0,"Indian tea with a delicious aroma and intense flavor. a brand that I have met often in India and which I had pleasant memories . often i prepare the variant "" chai masala "" with fresh milk , cardamom , cinnamon , fresh ginger root and sugar. warmly recommended ."
1,"Pleasant mixture of fruit tastes and the level of carbonation is refreshing.<br /><br />However, I found--particularly in the initial tastes-- the drink to be too sweet. You may well enjoy it, though, since I prefer carbonated fruit drinks more on the citrus/sour end.<br /><br />The over-sweetness isn't accomplished with added sugar, or non-sugar additives; the sweetness comes from the apple and grape juice concentrates, which are the top two non-water ingredients."
0,This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy. It is not iced tea. It tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves.
1,"I found the Switch Kiwi Berry Flavor to be good enough, but a little too sweet for my personal taste. I liked the fact that it was overly carbonated, and the amount in the can is just right, not too much to drink<br />at one time. It makes portion control easy. Would I buy it instead of a soda? Maybe not."
1,"I found this to be a nice alternative to juice and to the usual pepsi that I normally drink.<br /><br />It had a nice light flavor with just a little carbonation.  I don't believe tangerine is the right name for the taste. I would say a tart orange juice is more accurate. However, the name of the drink does not take away from the quality of the product.<br /><br />I let my children try a little bit of this and they too thought it was a very good taste.<br /><br />The cans are small, smaller than a coke can, but I found one to quench my thirst better than any of the caffeinated drinks I would normally pick up."
0,Loose tea is the way to go and this brand is no exception. Lots of flavor and the packaging seals in the freshness very well. It's not cheap- but you get what you pay for. You will not be disappointed if you are a tea drinker and enjoy not being locked into using tea bags.
0,"This tea punches you in the nose and then dances on your tongue.<br /><br />Open the can to a strong and distinctive bergamot aroma. The flavor is less intense. Well balanced and complex but still hearty with a wonderful lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />I love that you can brew the same leaves multiple times, it increases the value. I can usually brew this tea 4 times before it gets too weak.<br /><br />They recommend a 4 minute brew time which I've found to be too strong the first brew. I usually go 3min/4min/4min/6min on my first through fourth brewing.<br /><br />That's just what works for me."
1,"I love everything about this drink.  It's got plenty of carbonation.  Even without added sugar or artificial sweeteners, it's plenty sweet, without being too sweet.  I LOVE tangerine, and this has a very tangerine-y flavor and aroma.  If you love oranges or tangerines, this is the perfect drink for you.<br /><br />I ordered this from the Vine program out of curiosity, but it will be one of my ""must buy"" items in the future.  I'm also going to buy some for my grandchildren.  Since it has no added sugars, and I know they'll love it, it will be perfect for them."
1,"I first encountered this flavor at an airport magazine stand.  I sampled a couple and was hooked.  I thought this flavor was the best of all in the TicTac line.  On my flight, I was munching on the pack absent-mindedly.  I landed with the idea of buying several packs.  Then came the rude surprise - Grapefruit flavor is not a common sight on TicTac stands - anywhere.<br /><br />I finally settled on this purchase as the only way to maintain a steady supply.  This flavor of TicTac is best used as a ""chaser"", following a heavy-duty breath freshening from TicTac Power Mint, the blue color.  Not only is Power Mint effective, it also numbs out my tongue for several minutes.  A follow-up with a single Grapefruit restores my mouth to normality.<br /><br />I rate Grapefruit as the best flavor, with Watermelon and the new Strawberry Foelds close seconds.  In general any flavor TicTac is effective breath-freshening, but Grapefruit is truly addicting.  TicTac settles the issue that the tongue is a major contributor to sour breath."
0,"I did not care for this product at all, I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school. I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree."
3,"I really enjoyed this, and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well (if they are re-stocked - it seems that most of them are sold out).  I wanted something a little better than what I find in my area grocery stores, and this was really good.  The first time we made it, it was with milk, and it was a little too rich for me (which I thought was impressive, especially as I was only using skim milk), so I've since moved to a combination of milk and water, and it tastes GREAT (and I'll probably still make it with just milk, after adjusting more towards that over time).  My house is known for hot cocoa (we have at least 7 options right now), but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it."
3,"These small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that I have never been able to find in the past when I wanted them.  Amazon now provides a link.  They can be used for what are commonly called ""jello shots,"" and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups."
1,My latest beverage addiction.  The only thing I don't like is that temporary noxious cloud that arises when you put it in water.
1,Its nice to have a 'treat' to give my kids that they feel like they are getting soda---they love the taste and I don't feel like I'm having to compromise any quality .....<br />I don't enjoy soda but I do enjoy this product and occasionally will grab a can--great product at a good price!
0,"This sells for $29.99 at Bed, Bath and Beyond. Add your 20% off coupon and you're good to go ...<br /><br />I also had cabinet issues and returned it to BB&B."
0,I love the Loose Tea. The bag tea has a harsh taste compared To the loose tea. If you drink more than 1 cup a day use a CLEAN (never used for Coffee) Coffee pot. Small 4 cup pots only need 1 tea spoon for weaker a little more for stronger tea.
1,"These drinks are pretty good.  Nice to have something different to drink rather than the usual soft drinks filled with sugar and syrup.  This one is also more refreshing than soft drinks, and a little more interesting than just regular fruit juices.<br /><br />Everyone's tastes are different, but in my opinion they are surely at least worth a try!"
4,All our kitties love these treats. They come running at treat time. It's their favorite treat. Seafood is a favorite flavor.
4,"My cats are more enthusiastic about Turducken than just about any other cat food. They literally lick the plate clean. Even my LaPerm, who usually just gives me ""silent meows,"" manages to squeak out an audible meow when I start putting this on a plate.  The ingredients are much higher quality than many brands, too (no by-products, corn, etc.). I will be ordering more."
0,This is part of Dr. Oz's Tea Diet. Works like a charm. I have lost inches already and I have been on it for 4 days.
2,i love this stuff! im 15 yrs old and i like to eat organic/healthy/non-processed foods and this stuff definitely gets the job done. its a very healthy way to start off the morning and its only cost 14 bucks!
0,"I love this tea. It has this very clean taste, not bitter at all. I am from the south and love ice tea, but the caffeine and sugar made me search for a healthier option. I began to use green tea w/ a little mint in place of the traditional black tea. I use very little sugar and filtered water. My daughter likes it way to much and my northern husband is hooked, so is his mom. I have made the tea with several brands and this by far is our favorite."
1,"Very refreshing!  Ingredients are 3 different fruit juices, sparkling water, and no sugar!  About 150 calories per can, and they're smaller than regular soda cans.  So the ingredients are pretty natural, but 150 calories might be too much for some people!"
1,"The first ""Switch"" carbonated drink I tried from the amazon vine program is the watermelon-strawberry and now, here I am trying the ""kiwi-berry"" flavor. I've said before that I am not a fan of carbonated drinks and this flavor just reminded me why.<br /><br />There's no taste of berry nor kiwi in it, and the thing just flat out tastes like carbonated plastic. For a drink claiming to be ""all natural"", no sugar, or preservatives...it sure tastes quite like the opposite. Now I don't know if I just received a defective can, but it isn't it sure didn't quench my thirst and I needed to eat a ""hot pocket"" just to get rid of the odd after taste. Cool packaging, less than good taste.<br /><br />I didn't like it! [2 Stars]"
3,"This is NOT hot chocolate in the classic sense. This is a hot, chocolate beverage not to be wasted on young children or adults lacking taste buds. You have to be someone that really ENJOYS flavors, textures, etc. to get the difference or you might as well stir up some swiss miss."
0,"The first ball worked pretty well, it just looked a little beaten up.  Since then, ~half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water (all of them do after sitting for a bit).  If you don't mind the rate of failure, the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time (especially considering that it is white tea)."
3,"The belgian dark chocolate is the best hot cocoa I've ever had so far and my 4 year daughter agrees.  She pinicky about her chocolates preferring only to eat dark chocolate and this dark choco. hot cocoa sure passed the test with her.  She prefers to drink it with just warm water instead of milk as using milk makes it taste like ""milk chocolate"".  I do, too!"
1,"There's nothing wrong with this drink, but it really just tastes like any other orange soda.  Kudos to The Switch for not adding artificial flavors, sugar, or corn syrup, though.  It tastes pretty clean and refreshing, but a bit expensive for what it is.<br /><br />Don't let the small-sized can (8.3oz) fool you, this isn't an energy drink, it's just an orange soda."
0,"If you love good quality tea, always buy the ""Full Leaf"" type.  You will enjoy it!  Zen, is my favorite!"
0,Tin container not laced in the plasic crap..  The tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong.  Taste wise it's stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to -- not a gulper - chuckle.  It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal.  Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important.  The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away.  Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product.
0,This is the second time I have ordered this tea. It has a wonderful flavor and very smooth.<br />I drink two cups every morning instead of coffee now. I was drawn to this product because<br />of Dr. OZ.
1,"Kiwi and strawberry are a good combination, and combined with a bit of carbonation, this drink ""hits the spot"".  It is made from real fruit juice (concentrate), but it still has 33g of sugar.  As a ""snack"" or ""treat,"" it would be good, but I don't think I would drink it if I was just thirsty.  8.3oz isn't much.  Nice concept similar to an ""energy"" drink, but not just sugar and caffeine."
0,I like the twinings tea mix as you can try four different flavors from the same box.
1,"At 22.99 for a pack of 24 cans of Switch orange Tangerine, you're paying about 96 cents per can. Is it worth it? Not really. First of all, you drink juice for health reasons. Vitamins, frutose over corn syrup and the like. Carbonating beverages generally aren't considered good for you, so it's odd that the two would be mixed.<br /><br />Besides the carbonation, and the aluminum can (which has been proved can lead to Alzheimer's) there's a lot of deceptive marketing going on. The can claims that Switch is 100% juice, but it's not actually 100% Orange and Tangerine juice. In fact, the drink is mostly apple and grape juice. You can taste this instantly, along with the metallic tang of being in a can. This is done because both of those juices are quite cheap in comparison to orange and tangerine. So really, you're getting more a a carbonated fruit punch then an orange tangerine drink.<br /><br />You're also gettinbg ""Natural flavours and colours"" which kind of kills the whole ""100% juice"" claim.<br /><br />With a taste that is both metallic and not really resembling the flavours it claims, I can't really recommend this product, You can generally buy boxed 100% juice for less, which contains more flavour, no aluminum and no carbonation."
1,These taste good - kind of like cherry koolaid. 95% organic ingredients make it a bit healthier than koolaid. Better than the Clif Bloks (I say that b/c the cola Clif Bloks have a medicinal after taste).
3,"This is by far the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted!  All the other flavors are good, especially the raspberry, but this one is my favorite.  I use just hot water, and it tastes rich and creamy!"
1,I got this drink expecting the carbonated taste combined with kiwi and berries. Well I could taste the berries but no kiwi. I did like the carbonation with real fruit juices without the added sugar but it is not low cal. I think that I liked this drink better than the tangerine drink but still is not for me. The drink is way too sweet for me to enjoy it.
0,"Decent every-day loose-leaf tea. The China Mist brand is good, the only downside is some of the tea is pulverized too fine, so there is sediment in the tea. I recommend letting the tea settle before serving. China Mist is not extremely high-quality, just a nice every-day tea that tastes fine. The sample pack gives you a chance to try some variety, and it lasts a while."
3,Grove Square Milk Chocolate Cocoa k cups are great! I usually make hot cocoa from scratch with milk over the stove. I thought this was easier and delicious. To add creaminess I put in either a splash of milk or a shot of whipped cream--perfect!
1,"I'm not sure what I expected - maybe something thin and bubbly - but Switch delivers a rich, full orange-tangerine flavor.<br />It's got a lot more flavor, and good flavor at that, and a bit less carbonation than other carbonated fruit drinks.<br />An 8 ounce can has 140 calories, no fat, 15mg of sodium, 35 grams of carbs, 34 grams of sugar (they claim no sugar added), and no protein. It also contains 100% of your daily requirement of Vitamin C and 20% mdr of Vitamin A.<br />I tried it chilled with breakfast and thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,"As part of Amazon's Vine Program I received two trial cans of The Switch, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">Black Cherry</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">Orange Tangerine</a>. I tried both flavors cold (over ice) and rated them 4 stars each, although I prefer the Orange Tangerine flavor to the Black Cherry.<br /><br />Whether or not The Switch is just right or not sweet enough for you will depend on your personal experience with carbonated juice drinks and soda. If you are looking for the sweetness and fizz of a diet soda you will be disappointed. These are 100% juice drinks. The Orange Tangerine flavor has 140 calories and the Black Cherry has 130 calories.<br /><br />I recommend them as an alternative to regular juice to liven up your lunch or help you refuel after a workout. Either way, you are getting 100% of your Vitamin C and there's no added sugar or corn syrup, no preservatives and no artifical colors.<br /><br />The Black Cherry flavor was too mild for me. I was looking for more bite. I could taste hints of the apple, grape and acerola juice concentrates in the blend. The flavor reminded me of blends I've tasted from Treetop. Again, The Switch has a lot less carbonation than you would find in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW"">Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Blackberry Juice</a>, for example.<br /><br />The Orange Tangerine flavor should be renamed the Tangerine Orange flavor to reflect the dominate taste and aroma. The Switch's blend is as flavorful as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWQ"">essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001L4EME4"">San Pellegrino Orange</a> although, again, it is no where near as carbonated as those other brands.<br /><br />In summary, these all natural, 100% juice drinks are a healthier option than drinking a soda. The Switch also can help break up the monotony of drinking plain water and/or juice after a workout. Remember to keep them the cans ice cold, though. Preferably, serve them on the rocks.<br /><br />BTW: If you are looking for a full-flavored Black Cherry soda, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P9GB4Y"">Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda</a>, which has 170 calories per bottle. There's a low calorie (10) version as well but it isn't available on Amazon."
3,"Great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k-cups have.  I've tasted several and this by far is the better one, but I have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.  Will definitely purchase more, but at the rate my family downs these, we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective."
1,"The Switch Juice is pretty good!  It is 100% Juice, and LOADED with complex carbohydrates!  It has to be loaded, considering the 135 calories (at a little over 8 oz), and the 33g (!!!) of sugar.  I did like the sweet/tart taste which reminded me of the candy with the same name.  I also liked the fact that it's carbonated, but not too noticeable because of the sweet/tart taste.<br /><br />The pros of the Switch Juice are:<br />No Sugar Added<br />No Corn Syrup<br />No Preservatives<br />No Artificial Colors<br />100% Pure Juice<br />All Natural<br /><br />The cons:<br />The price per can (considering 8.3oz size)<br />The calorie load<br />The sugar content<br /><br />So, if you like juice and are looking for something to drink after a long workout, this one is a good choice.  You get energy and great taste in a somewhat small can.  Gatorade is much cheaper and a better choice for quenching thirst."
1,"This Kiwi Berry flavored drink from The Switch is a refreshing and tasty beverage that beats soda any day of the week.  Though carbonated, the drink has a smooth taste to it and goes down easy, and the Kiwi Berry flavor in particular tastes great.  Refreshing, worthwhile, and much healthier than any diet soda or nearly any other carbonated beverage, The Switch is definitely worth trying out if you're looking for something refreshing, healthy, and tasty."
3,The hot chocolate is fine but the price here is crazy.  You can get the same thing on the Keurig site for under $15.
4,"I have one cat who cannot tolerate THIS PARticular Fancy Feast Salmon Product. It is only the Shredded one that gets her, but get it does.<br />Everytime she eats it, she throws it up all over everywhere. My shoes, the white rug and gratefully, the tile.<br /><br />She ate this for several years with occasional upsets, but now it is EVERY time. No more for this family. I realize that this occurs on an individual basis USUALLY.<br /><br />But, I also have one younger kitty who is at the ""occasional upset"" stage. So, if you have a kitty with a tender tummy, I would avoid this!!"
0,"Can't start the day without a pot of this tea! Loose tea brewed in a ""coffeemaker"" has been my morning mainstay for decades. Start with cold, filtered water and a scoop (rounded tablespoon) of loose tea per cup into the paper basket filter. Adjust per taste. If you use a machine where coffee had been brewed, it may affect the taste, so use any new machine and keep it just for tea. This makes wonderful iced tea!<br /><br />Loose tea is a broader cut leaf unlike teabags where the leaf is chopped fine. The flavor is much fuller and crisper, like the difference between fresh ground coffee and instant. No messy teabags to contend with. I like glass mugs, as they let the gorgeous color of the tea show through.<br /><br />Some areas may not stock Lipton loose tea in stores, but buying online turned out to be cheaper. Six half-pound boxes arrived in two days. A box will last me about two weeks, but I drink tea exclusively. There are many good ""imported"" teas that are much more expensive and a lovely addition, but for my daily enjoyment, Lipton's is a delicious necessity. This is the preferred tea when using French presses or a traditional teapot."
1,"I actually liked this drink a lot.  It tasted like...  hmm.  I have no idea how to describe its taste.  Sort of like a fruit juice spritzer maybe?<br /><br />It didn't have much of a smell, but there was a distinct strawberry flavor.  It wasn't too sweet, and there was a little tartness to it (the kiwi?).<br /><br />The carbonation was pretty mild, so I didn't feel as bloated as I do when I drink a soft drink.<br /><br />It has about the same number of calories as the equivalent orange juice, and a lot of vitamin C...  but I'm not going to swap it for my morning OJ.  Nor am I a really big soft-drink fan, but if it's a choice between Sprite or Switch?  The cost is similar.  I think I might Switch!"
0,"I love this tea,it is so sweet it tastes as if it has sugar or some sweetner added. My favorite evening drink."
1,"I love these bitters, which have a taste all their own.  Good in drinks, good in soda water.  Refreshing mixed with other flavors or alone."
0,"This tea has an excellent flavor and I reuse the tins by buying larger quantities in bulk and storing in the tins. I have a ""tea station"" on my counter with a tin of this and a tin of the Earl Gray always at hand. A note to those of you who prefer your tea iced...use this with a coffee filter in your iced tea maker or through sieve and you won't be disappointed!"
0,"I just LOVE this tea. I am a very picky tea drinker and this is the only one that I currently drink. The loose tea tastes so much better than the old tea bags. I highly recommend it.<br />I drink my tea steamy hot with a little bit of milk, and that's what keeps me going in the morning."
0,"Green Tea is amazing! I was first exposed to it while stationed in Okinawa many years ago. At first I did not like the taste because I was used to that cheap orange pekoe Lipton junk I grew up with. But after a day or two, I was hooked. Twinnings has captured that classic Green Tea energy. This tea is both relaxing and energizing, which makes it difficult to both describe and explain. However, when you try a tin, you will know what I mean. We now buy all our teas on Amazon because they have made it most affordable and very, very easy. Kudos to both Amazon and Twinnings...a winning combination!"
0,"I found an excellent infuser and loose leaf Earl Grey all in the same day. This may become my daily tea. Does well on a 2nd steeping- still smooth and slightly smokey, not at all bitter tea flavor comes through nicely with maybe a bit less bergamot zing than the first time, still very tasty. You can really tell the difference on teas like this one which use real bergamot, especially of good quality. And a decent black tea is often missing in even some of Earl Greys with good bergamot, which is sometimes used to hide inferior leaves. Rishi included high quality in both departments, so the tea carries through on its own even after the spicy citrus does its work. It may be a bit strong for some, and I wouldn't know what is considered better from a traditional point of view (I'm not British), but it's just right for me. My favorite Earl Grey to date."
0,"Upon opening the package I thought that the tea had absolutely no aroma and looked old as if it was sitting somewhere in an open container for months.  After brewing, it revealed a bland taste at best.  It was like drinking brewed hay.  I checked the expiration date which is two years from now.  Maybe I had a bad batch but it's going back.  I had a better experience with Rishi Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Leaf Tea.  I do not recommend this tea to anyone."
0,I moved to Las Vegas from San Jose last year and have been missing my Peet's Coffee Jasmine Downey Pearls tea.  When I saw this product I bought a shipment right away. I was not disappointed.  I love the individual silken sachets of Jasmine Tea pearls.  It is fragrant and wonderful tea. I will be buying it again.
0,"This is my new favorite tea. It is absolutely delicious and even after it's sat and gotten cold, it's good. I'm not a fan of milk in my tea but I'll drink this without sugar, no problem. It has a naturally creamy flavor. Fantastic tea."
0,"I tried this tea as my introduction to Rooibos.  I was very excited after hearing of the benefits of rooibos.  To my dissapointment I thought this tea was disgusting!<br /><br /> Luckily, I didn't give up and tried other brands (Numi and Yogi are great) of rooibos and they were all fantastic.  This tea has a stale vanilla taste that completely covers up the natural flavor of rooibos.  Stay away from this tea.  Plain rooibos without added flavors is perfect on it's own."
0,"This is the first time we bought this tea from Amazon, we used to get it directly from Revolution Tea. I don't know if that made any difference, or if it was just a change in the tea's composition (along with the packaging), but what used to be my wife's favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste, with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong, almost cheap-generic-green-tea flavor. Really disappointing, especially since we're stuck with six boxes."
3,"This is the best candy cane cocoa, and it has real bits of candy cane. Don't worry, it's not totally sharp... Most of it dissolves in the liquid.<br /><br />I mix my cocoa with a battery operated frother, which uses every single bit of cocoa, so there is not a single bit of cocoa on the bottom.<br /><br />After, it's really a pepperminty cup of chocolate that is very lovely. Refreshing, I'd say.<br /><br />This is a must with milk, though I think you can do it with water... but milk is best to get the full flavor effect."
0,"Excellent tea for the money. Love the taste and it's all organic. Makes excellent ice tea as well. Try their other flavors too, they are just as good."
4,Excellent cat food for mature cats and an excellent value.  For $1 more you get twice as much as buying it at a pet store.
3,"I have read some really funny reviews about this product.  Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.<br /><br />I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  I've dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.  I'll buy it again!"
0,We tried the tea hot and really liked the taste.<br />So we tried it as iced tea and it comes out great in the iced tea maker using 3 bags per pitcher.<br />My previous favorite was Stash peach black tea and I usually don't like the peach teas that are not from black tea.<br />Stash is still a close 2nd.
1,"Not too sweet, not overly carbonated - can be best described as a good orange punch mixed with Perrier.  And while it is all natural, it is also reconstituted.<br /><br />And that's the rub, while tasty (tangerine is the most prevalent flavor with hints of white grape and a slight grapefuit finish), this is basically just expensive, carbonated juice.  Can size is the same as a Red Bull, 8.3 oz versus the industry standard 12 oz serving.<br /><br />Is more better? Not necessarily, but then again sometimes less is just less.  At approximately $2 per can, which category The Switch Orange Tangerine is, is for you to decide."
3,"This has to be without a doubt the WORST tasting Hot Chocolate ever! The best way to describe the taste of ""This Stuff"" is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. Swiss Miss instant is way better and cost less. After only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this ""SLOP""!"
1,"Like Izze, the basic idea here is soda made with actual fruit juice. No sugar, no HFCS, no preservatives, no coloring; just 100% fruit juice concentrate and sparkling water. Fruits listed are apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola (whatever that is).<br /><br />Intriguingly, the can mentions ""contains soy"" at the end of the ingredients list. There's no protein content listed, so it must be a trace amount. Something to bear in mind if you have a soy allergy, however.<br /><br />Flavor is fantastic. I'd have a hard time choosing between it and Izze, but I think I might just give Switch the edge."
1,"I didn't mind the taste of this very much - it tasted like Minute Maid OJ mixed with soda.  My husband couldn't stand it at all.  My only issue with this was that it was a heavy-syrup sort of flavor that was a little overwhelming.  If there was a better balance of flavor to liquid to make it a little lighter tasting, I think this would be much more refreshing and enjoyable.  Might be fine for kids though - since they like that sugary orange stuff."
3,Love this brand. Great price with save and subscribe. My husband loves them. Top with whipped cream in a can and I have a happy man. I wish you could buy all pepermint cocoa.
3,"This is, hands down, the absolute best hot chocolate ever. First had it years ago in a little cafe in Va. Have been ordering it online ever since. Have also given it to friends & family as a gift and everyone raves about it. A wonderful taste of chocolate mixed with just the right spices. Try it once and you'll be hooked."
0,"We use loose tea all the time, and regular loose tea has become hard to find in our local grocery stores. This subscription is great."
1,"The drink flavor is Kiwi Berry but I tasted a lot of flavors in it besides Kiwi and Berry. There are six fruit juice concentrates included. Note that Kiwi, although listed first on the can label before Berry, is the third fruit listed on the ingredient panel after Apple and Grape. Acerola (Barbados cherry or wild crapemyrtle per Wikipedia), Raspberry and Strawberry are listed as numbers 4, 5 and 6.<br /><br />I tried the beverage cold without ice then with ice.  Even drinking it a little later after it got watered down with the ice it was still a strong flavor and still tasted carbonated.  I noted that there was no aftertaste from Kiwi that I find in other drinks like Hansen.<br /><br />I don't believe the smaller size (8.3 oz.) was created for children, I think it is small to compete with the energy drinks out there that seem to appear in a similar size can.  HOWEVER, there is no caffeine, no added sugar, no guarana, or other ""energy"" added ingredients in this drink so it is safe for children and adults who do not wish to drink stimulant type drinks.  But, another HOWEVER is that this drink is 135 calories just for 8.3 ounces, 34 carbs including 33g of sugar (natural from the fruit juice concentrates).  There is 15mg of sodium and 100% of an adults daily requirement of Vitamin C.<br /><br />I am not sure if I would buy this drink again but it does taste nice.  I would like to try some other flavors from The Switch, however.  This one might make a good base for a punchbowl drink (with ice cream?)<br /><br />I think I should have given this drink fewer stars, now that I think about it."
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry is really good.  The taste is different.  It has a nice sour taste, and also is healthier than soda due to the low sugar content."
1,"This could be a nice beverage alternate to sodas, but with 33 grams of natural sugar it is worse than a soda pop.  The taste was unique and refreshing and not too sweet consider the amount of sugars.  Maybe it's the natural fruit juices that add to the sugar content.<br /><br />One thing that is not good is that the first and second ingredients are not kiwi or berry juice but apple and grape juice concentrates.  This add loads of sugar and calories, and, the 135 in this small can might be better spent elsewhere for us dieting officinados. But, the taste is fairly undefined and could be confused with others, like the cherry which I also got."
4,My 2 month old kitten loves this! I bought this to introduce her to canned food as I found nothing but dry food at my local store for kittens. I was excited to bring this home and have her try it. It was love at first taste...she gobbled it right up!
2,"I have several types of baby food molds and this is my favorite. It is soft and rubbery so I am able to push up from the bottom of the mold to remove the food. I don't like having to run hot water over the back, like I have to with my other molds, because I don't like tap water getting on the food. (I'm a little obsessive, compulsive) Just make sure not to fill the molds all the way to the top because the food expands and then you'll have food on the lid. Makes for easier cleaning if you don't get food on the lid."
3,"These Grove Square Hot Cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the Keurig. We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good.<br /><br />Dark Chocolate - My favorite, very good even on the ""large"" cup setting<br />Milk Chocolate - Excellent on the ""small"" cup and good on the ""large"" cup setting<br />Peppermint - Everyone likes this one, on either cup size setting<br /><br />These do contain Sucralose in addition to sugar, I don't notice the taste but my wife does (but she still likes them).<br /><br />Highly Recommended! We tried these in the smaller variety pack, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q64K"">Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups Variety Pack, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 12-Count (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />CFH"
3,"You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls!  The regular chocolate ones are good, but THESE are the BEST EVER!!"
2,"I love this product! I have several of these that I got for my daughter. She makes her own baby food for our grandchildren. But I have some as well. When the kids come to our home, we keep snacks, fruit, and dry cereal pieces in the cups for the children to enjoy.<br /><br />During the summer we use this to make frozen fruit or yogurt pops. It travels well and cleans up easily. Just an excellent item that I wish had been around when I was a young mom."
0,"Every Revolution product I have tried has been a wonderful experience.  Revolution knows how to balance the inherit flavors of tea leaves with other ingredients which make each tea unique and enjoyable.<br /><br />Better Than The Rest<br /><br />I've been buying this particular tea consecutively for the better half of a year now, and I simply love it. No other pomegranate tea comes close to this one in terms of quality and taste.  For example, Trader Joe's store brand (while good) seems as if it has been sweetened (to the point where it's too sweet), and surprisingly the tea turns red after less than a minute of seeping indicating that coloring was added (I didn't check the ingredients, so I may be wrong about this).  There's also Yogi's pomegranate tea which uses a green tea and creates an entirely different taste. I liked it; didn't love it.<br /><br />Complimenting Flavors<br /><br />Pomegranates are often compared to apples.  In fact, pomegranate means ""seeded apple"" (from latin: pomum - apple and granatus - seeded), and like an apple the fruit is sweet and tart, but has a very strong and distinct flavor.  Thus, a light white tea is the perfect companion; it doesn't overpower the pomegranate flavor but allows it to mingle on the tongue.  Likewise, the amount of pomegranate, or rather the intensity of the pomegranate flavor, is truly perfect.  No flavor overpowers the other, but rather all the flavors compliment one another.<br /><br />Brewing<br /><br />I'm sure someone out there will say that I'm butchering tea when I brew this, but when I do, I leave the tea bag in the mug until I've consumed it all.  I find that the taste never gets too strong and never gets bitter.  Typically this is only the case for herbal teas, which don't become overpowered since they contain no tea leaves.  In this case the same is true, perhaps because it is a white tea which is naturally light. The tea itself literally contains dried pomegranate seeds (flesh included).  Do you know that taste you get a few moments after you eat a pomegranate seed? (If you don't, try it! It's wonderful.)  That initial bite from the tartness followed by sweetness you get (or at least I get) from a pomegranate is captured in this tea, and it makes sense! There's pomegranate seeds in there!<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Buy this tea!  I was a little skeptical about my first purchase since I was buying 6 boxes, but it was a great choice that I do not in the least bit regret.  I've bought this for myself and for family, with everyone absolutely loving it. Best $20 I have ever spent (and continue to spend)!"
3,If you haven't tried the Stephens Candycane cocoa you need to try it  but only if you like chocolate and mint flavors.  It's great tasting.  The only problem is that I want it year around and it is only available in stores at Christmas.
4,"My cats love the food, and it's on the HAPPY list of ""Companies that Don't Test on Animals"" linked through the PETA site, peta.org.  That is VERY reassuring."
1,"I realize that it is not quite healthy to guzzle 12-16 oz. canisters of liquid at a sitting, but this Switch Orange Tangerine flavored drink was so light and refreshing, and tasted so natural, that I could easily have downed another 8.3 oz can - or two. And that is the only reason this drink did not receive five stars - I wanted more and the little can was just not enough! It is the perfect size for a child, however - so perhaps that who the drink is targeted for. As an aside for those who prefer their beverages more adult-oriented, this Orange Tangerine Switch would make an awesome mixer with gin or vodka - cheers!"
1,"The citrus flavor is crisp and clear in this carbonated juice.  It's not too sweet, and the bonus of having no added HFCS or sugar is a winner.  The carbonation cuts the sweetness in a nice tart balance.  It is still high in calories, like any juice is, but I would definitely turn to this beverage over any of the manufactured sodas that contain added sugar, HFCS or preservatives."
1,I love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet.The combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst  without leaving an unpleant after taste. t
1,"I like the fact that this drink has none of the additives that you typically find in supermarket junk drinks such as high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors or flavor enhancers, magnesium sulphate, fake colors, etc. It tastes good. There is also an abundance of Vitamin C.<br /><br />But for health watches note it still packs a modest wallop of calories (135 cal) from its 33g of sugars, albeit natural-not bad, but if you are on a calorie restricted diet or in physical training, you will want to watch it. If you sit back and pop these all day you will still get fat. But this would be a great drink for active folks. Personally, I would drink this after a tough mountain bike ride or long distance run.<br /><br />The level of carbonation is pretty high, so it has a fizzy texture."
1,"Whose crazy idea was this?  Someone who used to work for Bear Sterns or AIG selling derivatives?  Or is this Bernie Madoff's way of getting back at us all from jail?  Why take a nice juice like Kiwi Berry and add carbonation to it?<br /><br />Not only is is toooo sweet for a refreshing drink the carbonation makes me want to lose it.  The two things you can say for it is that it's ONLY 8.3 ounces (why not 8.2 or 8.7) or 245 ml (why not 250), and the can is returnable for a 5 cent deposit.<br /><br />It's not that this small amount has 33grams of sugar, it's that it's like chewing gum, the flavor lasts and lasts and lasts...rinse out with mouthwash or beer to get rid of it.  Yuch.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz"
4,"This may seem like a treat to my cats, but it really is food.  My two youngest cats prefer Tasty Treasures over all the Friskies flavors.  They sit and and eat until every last bit is gone.  I've never had a cat do that with any cat food.  I've been waiting for Amazon to carry all the flavors...at a reasonable price...so I can stop hauling them from my local Petstore.  I highly recommend this - especially if you have a picky eater."
4,"I was really hoping this grain free canned cat food will work for my 3 cats; looks like it has good ingredients but none of my 3 cats will eat it. In fact one of them will smell it and start doing the scratching thing like he smells poop. Another weird thing is the whole can is kind of soft and meshed like baby food but there are some whole green peas in it, not sure if that is by design or some green peas escape the meshing."
2,These are awesome and if you know where to find the discount codes they can be super inexpensive.  I love the all natural ingrediants and I actually find them to taste great.  I actually put a little in my older kids oatmeal and they love it too.  I make 90% of my daughters baby food but this great for on the go or as a supplement.<br /><br />My twin niece and nephew who are 18 months old love these as a snack and my sister says they are so great for car rides or trips to the museum.  I highly recommend these over any other baby food product.
4,"I was drawn to this product because it's called a ""feast"", but I was somewhat put off by it being a ""Fancy Feast"". My cat certainly deserves a feast! I mean, he runs himself ragged from morning till night going after mice and by the end of the day he's bushed. And frustrated too, since I had him declawed and all. But he don't need anything fancy, that's for sure. I just want him to enjoy a cat feast and leave it at that. He's not one of them cat's that prances around with his bushy tail waving around like some lady feline. I know my Tubby Toughie would be in cat heaven if they changed the name to ""Fighter Feast"" or ""Beastly Feast"". So, I'm giving this product 3 stars: five stars because it's a pretty great feast, minus three stars because the name offends Tubby Toughie, and plus one star because I like to lick the can."
3,"I see a lot of complaints about Grove Square hot chocolate. I think it tastes ok considering it's a k-cup, not homemade and not gourmet. I don't have anything negative to say the company or the product, it's relatively inexpensive and the company didn't falsely advertise or make any promises about the taste."
2,"We just started using these and my 7-month old daughter really likes them. I've tried a couple of bites and they are tasty with good flavor combinations. I love that they are organic. My only complaint not specifically related to the product is that when I got mine in the mail, one of the jars was broken and I had to clean the food off of the other bottles."
0,"I absolutely love Lana's Snowflake tea! I received a sample when I ordered the Finum Permanet Filter through Amazon (which, by the way, is the best filter I have ever used!). I fell in love with the Snowflake tea and had to order some for myself. It's fantastic!"
4,My cat is so picky! I've tried every brand and flavor and this is my cat's favorite.
3,I was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews. This is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water. I prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better. Adding milk didn't help much. I guess Mom spoiled me (good).
4,"So, I have an older indoor cat who has confined herself, more or less, to my bedroom, since our son was born a few years ago.  While in hiding, she put on a few pounds.  I got to thinking about this and the economy over the winter, and realized that it was better all around, to keep her healthy than to have an ailing senior kitty.  I did some research on what a quality cat food should be and came up with some qualifications and went shopping.  I returned with another brand- reasonably priced and fitting requirements.  My cat liked it alright.  And she lost some weight- fast.<br />  It was serious weight loss and I considered rethinking my own diet, but then we found she had fleas!!!  Poor thing had the worst flea infestation ever (ditto my closet and bedroom)!!!!  Apparently this can happen, even after ten years indoors, if outdoor humans bring flea eggs in on their shoes!!!  I'm told indoor cats often prove the worst flea sufferers- I believe it.  There is no where for them to run or hide.  The flea population explodes fast.<br />  She  dehydrated, anemic and completely exhausted, and dying,  I thought.  She had taken to staying on my window sill and would not touch the ground for anything (where fleas live), but of cousre that would be limitedly safe, too.  Well, I made some trips to the VET and pet stores,  and along with my flea aresenal I purchased some new cats foods to encourage her to eat.  I wanted  something with beef and liver, hoping  to help her get past the anemia.  Beef is harder to find than one might think, but there were a few, including Blue Spa.  I thought it a little expensive, but not when my first baby is so sick!  I opened it  first.  My desparate cat lept off the sill and ran to the kitchen- no lie!  It was the first decent meal she had eaten in days.<br />  Blue Spa Selects start with meat- be it fish, poultry or beef- not meat by products or broth.  The next ingredient is usually chicken and maybe liver.  After that is is a medley of nice vegetables and fruits and stuff-like sweet potatoes, wild rice, cranberries broccoli and blueberries.  The there's all the required nutrients and minerals and such. Sounds like a good meal, now doesn't it?  I admit, I found this concept a little over the top a few year back when I first heard of it.  But, you know, I have had cats who ate vegetables when the opportunity arose (I also had one who LOVED a nice coffee cake before company arrived).  When my sick kitty showed so much enthusiasm for this product, I realized that she must get bored with her food, same as I would.  All the good and different tastes in these little cans could be a new lease on life.  She is still quite thin, but gaining energy, looks good, and loves her new food.<br />  My only complaint is that the beef & liver variety is hard to find (not on Amazon, either, it seems).  We have tried the other flavors, now and they are equally loved.  Also- there's no ginger that I've seen, - a commonly complained about ingredient of a similar brand.  Will be trying other products from this company, soon, once I get rid of my fleas, too."
2,"I am a strong believer in giving my baby organic foods as much as possible. We used many of the Earth's Best flavors and baby really enjoyed most of them. What I found irritating though was how runny many of the flavors were; I often had to add oatmeal or rice just to keep the food on the spoon.  Water is added to many if not most of the flavors. I wondered if that was a necessity however ""Plum"" ""Ella's Kitchen"" and ""Happy Baby"" brands (also organic) do not have water as an added ingredient. We definitely used these, but to be honest, I prefered the other brands because I felt we were getting a better value considering we weren't paying for water in those packages."
1,"This 8.3 Fl oz can packs a walloping 135 calories.  Switch's can claims that it contains no added sugar or corn syrup and provides 100% of one's daily Vitamin C; it is made with 100% juice plus carbonation and is all natural.<br /><br />This drink cloyingly sweet and tastes like a kiddie drink (think dissolved lollipops). I prefer getting my Vitamin C from orange or grapefruit juice.  Lots of fruit juices are available that are natural, e.g., cranberry, apple, etc."
0,I ordered two of the Hazer Baa Turkish Apple Tea (pack of 2) as pictured so I would save on the shipping and instead received the Green Apple Tea (same brand and price).  It didn't taste like the original but I didn't want the hassle of sending it back and so I will not be ordering it again.  This tea did not have the strength or zing of the original.  I'm upset still.
2,My 8 month old loves this & has no problem holding it & sucking the food out.  This is great for on the go!
1,"So I got this and tasted it strait out of the bottle, it tasted like smoky flavored milk - YUCK! I was depressed I was stuck with 4 bottles of this.  It sat on my shelf and I forgot about it. Last weekend I tasted a Zevia cream soda and was not pleased with the flavor, it tasted weird and smokey like the LorAnn oil I had gotten.  I tried to doctor up the soda with a little SF Vanilla Torani syrup and a tablespoon of heavy cream - IT TASTED AMAZING!!!  The odd smokiness was gone and it had a wonderful rich mouthfeel.<br /><br />So I wanted to see if this would help the LorAnn oil too.  I put a cup of whipping cream in a bowl and added a teaspoon of vanilla and tasted it, it tasted fine.  Then I added ONE DROP of the oil, it is very strong, and stirred it in - IT TASTED SO MUCH BETTER!  I whipped it up and put it on fruit and it was such a treat.<br /><br />Now I will always whip a drop of it with vanilla into desserts and whip cream.  It was such a happy accident to find out how to use it.  When added to vanilla it really adds a new depth of flavor and tastes so different than just out of the bottle or on its own in cream.<br /><br />It is VERY potent so only use a drop and increase after tasting, if you add too much it will ruin the recipe so use a light touch."
1,"We are big Izzie fans, but we were excited to try this sode. We were VERY pleasantly pleased. It is a very orange taste, delicious and it feels good to know there is absolutely NO sugar. So, when our children want a soda we serve this and they are delighted. It's a win/win!"
0,"I love this tea. I make it strong and mix it with a splash of lemonade.  I copied a similar tea from Starbucks.  I like mine better, plus...it costs less!"
1,Hubby and I both shared the dring and we both liked it.  I really liked the fact that there was no added sugar in this drink.  It's a nice combination of flavors.  I found it a little too carbonated but he thought it was just right.<br /><br />I would buy it if it came in a larger can. Hence only 4 stars. I think this can is too small.  Too much aluminum thrown out.  I recyle everything but most people I know just toss it.  Otherwise I would buy this drink.
0,This tea is not so tasty in my opinion. But one thing about opinions is that every one has one and we do not always agree.
3,"I've been a fan of Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate brownie mix for a long time. And I also like Ghirardelli chocolate candy. So when I came across this chocolate mocha hot cocoa mix I wanted to give it a try cause I love cocoa and coffee. I'm glad I bought it because this stuff is delicious. I love the combination of chocolate and coffee. The coffee in it is very subtle and definitely not overpowering. It's rich, very flavorful, and bold. And as others have pointed out this is the best mix you can buy. I'm very impressed."
0,"I've read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as ""coffee tasting"" or with ""roasted flavors,"" but to be very truthful, it tastes just the way I could imagine second hand smoke would. It's very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. I've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this ""roasted"" flavor."
1,"I don't know if it has changed since then, but when I lived in Australia 14 years ago, one thing that stood out to me was how real drinks tasted compared to the artificial flavors typical of America.  Switch brought me back to those days.  It starts out tangy and the taste turns sweeter in my mouth.  If they knocked 50 calories off, I would definitely purchase this regularly."
0,"I received a tin of this admittedly not inexpensive tea for Christmas in 2006, and used it sparingly through the year. Then for Christmas 2007 I ordered a package of three tins, I love it so much! The tea flavor is not overpowered by the bergamot essence that makes this Earl Grey, yet it's a gentle tea, not overly tannic.  I'm a daily tea drinker and this is my favorite."
0,"This stuff is great. I just had to give it a good rating. I didn't know if I'd like this, but my fianc&eacute;e suggested we get this instead of the other tea varieties and that was a good call."
1,"This tastes like carbonated orange juice, very tart.  It is very expensive compared to easier-to-find similar beverages.  If one had allergies or health issues, it might be worth drinking."
3,Does not have a rich chocolate flavor. Tastes a little watery. Not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it.
1,"This carbonated blend of juices is a refreshing drink.  The kiwi and strawberry flavors come through more distinctly, and when drinking while eating, it is the strawberry flavor that dominates.  Because Switch is not as carbonated as soda, it does not need to have added sugar, a definite plus.  The lower carbonation also makes it easier to drink.  I am now intrigued to try the other flavors that Switch makes."
2,"Be careful when odering this, because they say it's a 6 pk, but you will only get a 4 pk, plus the formula goes out in 4 months.  So if you did like I did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck!  So I know I will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren, because they won't be able to eat it."
3,Premium Ghiradelli chocolate mixed with just a hit of coffee makes this a great drink.  I've gotten to where I add a heaping spoonful to my Starbucks coffee every morning.  It gives it an extra coffee flavor and the chocolate for Ghiradelli far exceeds the 'mocha' chocolate you get at most barista stands.
3,"I tried this unknown manufacturer ""Stephen's"" and was pleasantly surprised. It had a good amaretto flavor along with the chocolate. The aroma is good. I use it in my coffee for a homemade mocha taste."
0,"Though London Fruit and Herb Company's Blueberry Bliss tea is one of the best teas I have ever had I cannot understand why Amazon has not begun shipping it out to customers who ordered this item months ago! It IS now available through other Vendors (i.e. Wendell Tea Company in MA) but not at the Amazon price.  If is's available to them it should be available to Amazon or they should take it off their inventory as an offering.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A85G52"">London Fruit & Herb Company Blueberry Bliss Tea, 20-Count (Pack of 6)</a>"
4,"I felt really good about being a good cat mommy and buying something of such quality for my sweeties... Too bad none of the would eat it, no matter what I did.<br /><br />Donated it to the local SPCA -- maybe a dog will eat it."
3,"I was expecting something more... considering the Keurig does such a good job with coffee.<br />But this stuff? Everybody who sampled it here said it tasted just like Nestle's powdered hot chocolate in a mug with hot water. Watery, sugary, and nothing special."
0,"I am pleased the bag is so large; it means I'll be sipping this tea for a while.  This tea is perfect for the start of the work day:  the rose and hibiscus liven my senses; the caffeine pushes me to type a bit faster as I climb over a hillock of e-mails.  The flavors are a bit more pungent than similar blends I've mixed on my own (is the cause the mysterious ""natural flavor"" another reviewer pointed out?), but it is still quite pleasant.  I certainly look forward to many more mornings begun over several cups of rose congou."
3,"I use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks.  With the high price of cocoa on the commodity market, this is an excellent price, especially for an organic product.  The cocoa is less ""tasty"" than my regular brand, but does very well for the price.  My main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with NO label.  I would like to see an organic label, as well as, the nutrition info for the product."
3,"This cocoa has ruined all other cocoas for me! This is all I want now, but to be honest it is a little expensive, especially with shipping always applied. So when it arrives I hide it. I leave the Swiss Mix and the Nestles out, and save this for moments when I just want to indulge myself. I have shared it occasionally, but only when the kids are very, very good. Try it and treat yourself."
1,"I just purchased this today for 3.99. I can't believe this price. The product is wonderful however. Nice soda like fizz, but juicy instead of cloyingly sweet."
1,"This drink would have gotten 4.5 stars from my kids but as an adult, this drink was much too sweet for my husband and myself.  We would never drink anything this cloyingly sweet.  It's made with fruit juice concentrates and flavorings reconstituted with filtered sparkling water.  What I'd rather have, and what I make at home frequently, is a normal fruit juice, such as pineapple (no sugar added) and sparkling mineral water.  It cuts the sweetness of the juice, has just enough flavor, a little fizz and is even good for you.  Switch, I'm afraid has none of this, it's just too sweet and has too much fake flavoring.  We tried the Kiwi Berry and it tasted like overpowering strawberry fake-flavoring, like strawberry flavored candies.  Sorry, Switch, but you could make this simpler and better very easily."
4,"There are 4 kittens that started hanging outside the house and I started feeding them.  Rather than buying the smaller bags, this is a great value for multiple cats.  The kittens love the food and always look forward to eating it.  Shipped right to your door.  Can't go wrong with that!"
0,"As much of a tea fanatic as I consider myself, I'd never heard of guayasa before running into the Runa brand. Now that I have, I could see myself buying it over and over again! It has a full-bodied flavor without the bitter aftertaste of some black teas. It's earthy without being heavy-handed or overpowering, completely unique from any other tea I've tasted. You won't find tea like this anywhere else. And though the product speaks for itself, the business model of this brand doesn't hurt: Runa buys guayusa directly from local farmers in Ecuador at fair-trade prices. Try it! It's worth every cent :)"
2,This is the only food my daughter will eat consistly. She really enjoys it. The packaging is great. Never had any broken (having ordered 4 times).
1,"Note: This is my first review of a product that is not a book, so please forgive me if I miss something.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of fruit drinks like The Switch, but I decided to go ahead and give it a shot. After having my first drink, I can honestly say I wanted to hate it. I mean, seriously, I'm drinking this can of 100% fruit juice with carbonation and reading all these really stupid quotes all over the can (i.e. ""100% of what I want in a soda, 0% of what I don't""), wondering how much a 8.3 ounce can of this junk costs (thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.50 or $3.00; and thinking, if I wanted to drink some juice and would drink some juice! I couldn't stop thinking about what is so special about carbonation that I would want to drink this over a glass of OJ. I wanted to scream!<br /><br />However, I kept my cool, and finished the drink. There was something about this particular flavor that was enjoyable, but not engrossing. There was something in the aftertaste that I did not like, and I think it had to do with the tangerine juice. Tangerine's aren't my bag, either; but it was tolerable.<br /><br />After discussing this product with my wife (I know, this drink apparently also contains the conversation starter attributes, bonus points for that I suppose) she was like, ""this sounds great. Is it like those <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IW25RK"">Izze POMEGRANATE SPARKLING 100% JUICE DRINK</a>??"" I responded: ""Um.... I guess so...""<br /><br />I then also looked up the price and learned that I had grossly overestimated the price of a single can (being just over a single dollar). Despite my wanting to hate this product, I've decided to step out of my anti-contemporary culture box, view this product for what it is, and give it a middle rating of 3 stars.<br /><br />I can see the attraction; I can see the appeal; I just won't ever buy it. I'll stick to my glass of Orange Juice and Tang any day.<br /><br />Good drinking,<br /><br />J.Stoner"
2,I make my own baby food but when we travel I give my daughter plum organics and happy baby food. She likes them a lot so i wanted to try something with meat. This product has good reviews so I ordered it thinking you can't go wrong with sweet potatoes and chicken. But i was wrong it taste bad.My daughter won't eat it even when she is starving. She actually didn't want to eat anything for few hours after she tried it first time. I even spiced it up a little bit hoping that she likes it but nope:(I don't blame her.I don't like it either.<br /><br />Update: Few months later I reintroduced my daughter this product and she seems to like it now. She ate it well for week when we were traveling. I ordered another one for our upcoming trip.
1,"I didn't expect this to be this fizzy. Sure it's not like a Pepsi, but if you want some carbonation from a beverage in a healthier manner, this is a great alternative. However, you might be disappointed if you intend on replacing your favorite soda because you'd definitely miss the extra sugary flavor, thus leaving it to taste like a fizzy fruity tea.<br /><br />Still, I don't normally drink soda, and there are times that I definitely crave it. So these would be a good-enough substitute, especially if you're not used to extremely sugared beverages. I'd also feel very safe about giving this to children."
3,"A pleasant surprise awaited me when I first ordered Grove Square milk chocolate Hot Cocoa cups. Not a coffee drinker,<br />I use our Keurig K-cup brewer mostly to make cocoa, and a few other brands I tried simply did not hit the mark. Grove Square cocoa tasted full-flavored, with just enough chocolate essence to make it a perfect drink. The first experience made me anticipate (with pleasure) the next time I popped a Grove Square K-cup into the machine!"
1,"I really enjoyed this drink.  It tasted just like an orange soda, but I liked it more because it was 100% juice, and didn't have any extra additives.<br /><br />The only negative is that since it is 100% juice (and has no artificial sweeteners) it is high in calories -140 calories to a can, to be exact.<br /><br />However, if I were to choose between drinking this or drinking an apple or orange juice, I definitely would drink this as a treat.  Plus, it would be really fun to pack in a cooler, especially for the young ones in your family.<br /><br />Please note, it is not just a single type of juice.  It is a blend of several juices, so it is not ""carbonated OJ"", it is something just a little different."
0,"GREAT TEA.  IF ANYONE HAS NOT TRIED LOOSE TEA THEY NEED TO, BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING.  I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND THIS PRODUCT AGAIN.  MANY THANKS FOR KEEPING THIS WONDERFUL BEVERAGE.  FAST SHIPMENT AND GREAT SERVICE"
3,"This is simply the best hot chocolate mix I have ever used.  The flavor is wonderful, whether you like hazelnut or not (the hazelnut flavor is subtle.) It tastes like you made it from scratch rather than a mix.  It's difficult to find, so locating it on Amazon was a great find."
3,This makes an excellent hot chocolate.  I also make my own gourmet hot chocolate mix and I use a bit of this to kick up some of the mix.
3,"If you've never tried any of Ghirardelli's hot cocoa products you are in for a treat! Made with milk, the cocoa is far superior to any other cocoa product on the market. I don't drink coffee, but have a cup of this every morning. When made in the Froth Au Lait hot chocolate/latte maker, you will get the best cup of hot cocoa you ever had."
3,"We enjoy a cup of hot chocolate with our Keurig machine and used to have Cafe Escapes as our favorite.  When I saw the Grove Square brand at such a great price, I thought I'd give it a try.  We love it - it is now our favorite brand.  I will be back for more!"
2,"I have twin girls, they both loved the Vegetable Turkey Dinner.  It was one of their favorite baby foods.  Great price."
1,"Nice alternative.  Very lightly carbonated.  I'd say if a normal carbonated drink ranges from 80 to 100 on the fizzy scale, this one's about an 11.<br /><br />At 26 grams, it's still a lot of sugar (mostly from apple and grape juice, I think).  I'll order a case just 'cuz I thought it was good and I'm calling it 4 stars - but honestly, I'd rather have it 50% splenda or stevia sweetened."
0,"Dandelion root is reported to aid in reducing high blood pressure, which is why I drink it.  I've pretty much given up coffee drinking and this is a tasty substitute, though one must acquire a taste for it.  At home I use bulk roasted root but these tea bags are fantastic during travel."
3,Such good hot chocolate for the K Cup brewers out there!  DO NOT pass this one up!  Is not too sweet and very chocolatey :)
4,"This cat food is adequate and nothing more. It will feed your cat. My cat does not like it and I am stuck with a big bag. This is a bargain brand, and gets the job done."
1,"This tastes great and I like that it's more natural than most other sodas available. Basically, it's a carbonated juice.  I generally prefer a larger 12 oz. size though."
0,"This is really good green tea without bitterness or the orange discoloration which is a sign of ""old"" green tea. Stay away from the big brands like Lipton, Twinnings, and Bigelow. They do well with black tea but not green.<br /><br />For green tea go with this, Uncle Lee's, or Tazo. You'll never be able to go back to the others, which will taste like swill from a polluted river.<br /><br />This is real green tea. And it's not expensive. Recommended.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Rusk Reeder"
1,"I don't like artificial sweeteners because they're too sweet, so while sipping Switch's Kiwi Berry drink, I kept rechecking the can for a sign of any sort of diet ingredient. None were listed.  Switch says there's nothing but sparkling juice in the can, no sugar or artificial sweeteners, so that's that.<br /><br />I like the amount of sparkle in the juice, but as a thirst quencher, it was too cloyingly sweet, at least for me. This certainly doesn't mean you might not love it -- I just prefer my sweet with a good dose of tart.<br /><br />Verdict: I'll stick to a good old-fashioned kiwi-strawberry beverage from Snapple or Trader Joe's or Costco. They all have good ones.<br /><br />By the way, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> was also sweet, but far more to my liking."
3,"This cocoa is like any other cocoa, other than it is white and turns pink when touches liquid.  The tin is cute, but 2 cans were dented when they arrived. Not sure if it was from shipping or the seller.  A bit over priced in my opinion as well."
0,"I was drinking lots of tea from the local Jewel, Tetley's British blend. So when I saw this I thought it was an opportunity to try something better. Indeed its a lot better tea, does get strong nicely and I use skim milk. It tastes much better obviously than the Tetley in a box, its full bodied, but it did not have a refreshing taste.<br />The reason I say that is I was drinking some other Assam team from a store in Cleveland(Teavana) and that was very refreshing, full bodied. Likely it wasn't organic. Obviously the price at Teavana for a few oz. was a lot more per oz. than the Banaspaty tea, so it has that going for it.<br />The Twinings are pretty good, likely they have their own tea-estate, but my guess is the tea-estates vary in flavor.<br />But, hey, remember where I came from, Tetley's bags to Assam Banaspaty. Big leap for me."
0,I am so happy to have bought this tumbler.  It is very handy to have around and works beautifully.  I whole-heartedly recommend this product to anyone looking for a convenient tea-making device.  I love the blooming bulbs and how you can see them while it brews! :)
1,"Living in Germany for several years, I acquired a taste for Apfelsaftschorle or schorle for short, apple juice and sparkling water.  The soda water cuts the sweetness, gives the juice a little tang, and makes the drink a better hydrator; the juice makes the soda water a little more interesting.  I usually drink any fruit juice this way now.<br /><br />Switch premakes my schorle.  The blend was and orange citrus rather than apple, but very good regardless.  I tried it straight, but it would have been better over ice or if it had been mixed with a little more soda water and a little less juice.  The ingredients were juice, sparkling water, and a couple of stabilizers, without two of my pet peeves; artificial color, especially red 40, and high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and can recommend it as an excellent alternative to conventional soda.<br /><br />E.

0,"What the heck is going on with Lipton Darjeeling?  It disappeared from every one of the Indian shops in the S.F. Bay area about 6 months ago.  The tin you see above sold for about $11.  This tea was one of the best kept secrets I know.  Now the only tea approaching ... and I mean it is not as good ... it is Peet's Darjeeling, at $10 for 1/4 lb. tin.  The only other alternative for Darjeeling is to go to some of the Persian groceries and find it there.  They sell a brand that apparently has lower-quality Darjeeling that appears to be imported from India into Iran, then sent to U.S.  You could probably find other ethnic stores that have the same kind of thing.  Does anyone have an explanation for what is going on?"
2,These are the best!  What a wonderful way to provide a treat for yourself and your kids knowing how healthy and pure they are.  The taste is excellant and satisfies that sweet tooth.  Highly recommend that you try these.
3,Got these luscious wine chocolates to use as part of my stocking stuffers.  They were yummy and a big hit with everyone.  Would definitely buy again.
2,"I bought this for my mother on the recommendation of my family physician.  He said my mom has iron deficiency anemia.  As the name implies, iron deficiency anemia is due to insufficient iron. Without enough iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen. As a result, iron deficiency anemia can leave you tired and short of breath.  The solution: boost your iron intake.<br /><br />One tablespoon of this tasty delight has 70% RDA of iron and it tastes pretty good too.  If you like the taste of black licorice, I'd say you'll probably like the taste of this."
0,"I hate teas with orange in them but I have to say <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FO"">Twinings Lady Grey Tea, Loose Tea, 3.53-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a> is a nice smooth tea that is light and seems to have a touch less bergamot than the Earl Grey.<br /><br />The color is almost a golden yellow so I can see how some people would feel that it's too much like herbal tea but I thought it was rather tasty with just a touch of cream.  That being the bonus of this tea, you can add half of what you'd normally add to Earl grey [cream, lemon, honey] and save yourself a few calories.<br /><br />This is not a watered down version of Earl Grey, just a delicate tea."
0,"This is the second 6 pack I am having. I am used to having my tea with milk since childhood but wanted to turn vegan. If I follow the same process to make tea with same ingredients and leave out milk, it will be too bitter. I went all over the place and tried a zillion different kinds of tea and this one is the best. I am a 100% vegan now.<br /><br />I travel a lot. The coffee at gas stations and hotels is usually cheap and I hate it. I carry a handful of these and use it in hot water at gas stations or coffee maker in hotels.<br /><br />At home - I drink a LOT of tea. Lot of the spices listed on the packet are readily available at affordable prices at Indian grocery stores but they will be non organic. I have experimented with boiling those with fresh ginger root and long leaf black tea leaves. The output I get is different from Good Earth but inspired by them and equally flavorful. Over few attempts, I learned the proportions and boiling time to perfection. You got to be tea lover to do so much."
2,"My 8 month old loves these. He hardly swallows one bite before he's already opened his mouth for the next bite. I make my own baby food when I have time, but when I don't, this is a great alternative."
0,They refuse to ship this fine tea to Canada.  I have to go to the Middle East to find it and bring it back.
1,"In fact, I did not like the artificial taste in this orange drink. The degree of carbonation is alright and it does have an ""orangey"" taste to it. But I cannot ignore the artificial taste that accompanies this beverage. For now, I would stick with plain orange juice or other orange sodas like ""Crush""."
0,"This is the same Turkish tea you can drink in kebab establishments in Europe. It's typically served in tiny, tulip-shaped glasses on small saucers. On a cold day, it's really warming, and it's even refreshing in summer.<br /><br />This tea is brewed in a two-part teapot, typically stainless steel with a big pitcher below for hot water and a smaller teapot on top for brewing a strong infusion of the tea. You set the teapot on top of the hot water to brew, then use the hot water to dilute the tea to desired strength. This is similar to the way Russian tea is brewed in a samovar.<br /><br />One thing about this tea; there is a lot of tea leaf dust in the package. To avoid a sort of off flavor contributed by the dust, it's easy to wash the leaves before brewing. I put the tea into a tea strainer, pour hot water over the leaves and discard the water. The leaves go into the pot for brewing. This really improves the flavor. It's not unusual to ""wash"" tea leaves; in China, tea is often made by throwing off the first water infusion and quickly re-infusing the wet leaves.<br /><br />The flavor of this tea is more like Russian or China black tea--less snappy and tannic than Assam or Darjeeling."
0,"I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or ""bark"" a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy's extract."
4,"This is one of the few cat foods my fussy cat will eat.  He loves the gravy especially.  Wish they would sell that on it's own!  And amazon's subscribe and save is the best price I can find, and so convenient too!"
4,Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.
3,"Best hot chocolate available for K-cups. Best taste, after taste. Great in any size when brewed. Highly recommend over any other company."
2,My 10 month old took one bite made a face and refused the rest. She eats anything. I tried it and so did my husband. It tasted like potting soil and has a very bitter after taste. I feel like some of the veggies are not cooked long enough and thats why its bitter.
4,"This is the perfect food for my cat & in fact, the only one she will eat - wet or dry."
0,"This tea has NO flavor, tastes like dust It ""looks"" like quality -- pretty package -- but it's no good. Lipton regular Pekoe is farrr superior."
0,"I make a ""jug"" of this tea every morning and keep a glass throughout the day.  I'm delighted to find a source in the US as it was introduced to me in B.C.  It does not have the jasmine flavor which upsets my otherwise very strong tummy."
2,"i have ordered mackerel several times on amazon and most pleased with SEASONS brand than any other. seems to me the fish are smaller therefore less mercury.<br />packed in olive oil is also a bonus. they are not as ""fishy"" as others that i have tried. i eat them to get a healthy serving of omega 3. my 11 year old boy has taken a liking for them as well as my 14 year old daughter. we put a small chunk on a cracker and top with a ring of hot banana peppers.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDMW9M"">Season Fillets of Mackerel in Olive Oil, 4.375-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> i would recommend this brand. tom heflin"
1,IT SAYS ON THE BOX EACH DRINK CONTAINS: THE POTASIUM OF 2 BANANAS & MORE ELECTROLITES THAN A SPORTS DRINK. THEY MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE HIGH PRICED BUT GO TO GROECERY STORE BUY 2 BANANAS & 2 SPORTS DRINKS AND YOU WILL PAY MORE TO GET THE SAME NUTRITION YOU GET FROM 1 JUICE BOX OF THIS COCONUT WATER...
1,"I love the idea of carbonated juice - I really do. I love carbonation. I love juice. Put them together and you should have a sweeter version of what you can make with club soda and juice. So one star earned for the idea. One star for the convenience of me not having to mix my own club soda with juice and one star for convenience that it is in a can. As for taste - I didn't like it much at all. It was just too sweet. I like soda, but this was just over the top. This particular version my wife and I both agreed that it tasted really close to strawberry poprocks, which in and of itself is a good thing. I just didn't care for it as a carbonated fruit juice.  I'm going to give this a partial fail. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't buy it again."
0,"I came to the site looking for the white tea / tangerine flavor, but settled for the white tea/pear - I wasn't dissappointed.  This tea has a light smooth taste that is perfect for that after dinner or evening tea drink with little to no caffeine to keep you up."
0,"the tea was of high quality and came in biodegradable pouches that looked like silk bags, but I had two problems with it, first the orange taste was barely detectable, and the silk-like bags worried me because they did not state the material of the bags or how it might react to the heat of water that I would end up drinking, non the less these bags gave me a sense of luxury"
0,"Numi has a winner here with this tea! My husband, son and I often share this wonderful tea after dinner. It is very pleasant and the reason they love it, it does not turn bitter after longer steeping, like other teas do!"
3,"These Grove Square Hot Cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the Keurig. We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good.<br /><br />Dark Chocolate - My favorite, very good even on the ""large"" cup setting<br />Milk Chocolate - Excellent on the ""small"" cup and good on the ""large"" cup setting<br />Peppermint - Everyone likes this one, on either cup size setting<br /><br />These do contain Sucralose in addition to sugar, I don't notice the taste but my wife does (but she still likes them).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
0,I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.
4,"One of my cats developed a food allergy and was throwing up anything he ate. There are many types of food that the vet recommended trying (duck, venison, etc.) but he refused to eat any of those.<br /><br />Then we found this food, and all is good again.<br /><br />Thank goodness there's something he will deign to eat that won't aggravate his food allergies!"
0,"I usually never leave any reviews but since the product is worthy and there's no feedback at all I decided to do it. I ordered this tea because I have some mastopathy and my breasts hurt much during my cycle. Things seemed to get a bit worse a couple months ago so I decided to give this tea a try. I come from a country where there is a lot of trust in herbal medicine, I personally was exposed to Chinese herbal medicine as well so I thought I should try. I drank it for about a month once per day and I already see results! During this cycle my breasts got much better, almost not sensitive at all, just a bit by the very end of it. I will continue drinking it and will recommend it to all my girlfriends with the same problems. It is natural, it doesn't contain any hormones and it DOES work. It tastes very much like regular green tea with jasmine(because it has a small portion of both of them) and that's why I don't recommend to drink it before going to bed because it can keep you up( green tea has a bit of caffeine, a tiny portion). I drink it either in the morning or at  lunch time, it tastes good and helps you to wake up( and unlike coffee, green tea doesn't damage your kidneys)."
1,"As a kid I grew up picking and eating my own oranges, mangoes, bananas, watermelon other tropical fruits.  I know what 100% natural fruit juice tastes like and Switch kiwi berry does not taste like it is a product of 100% natural fruit juice.  This product like its watermelon strawberry cousin does not taste natural.  If kiwi flavor had been absent I don't think I could differentiate this product from a berry soda you can get from any vending machine.  Moreover I am not crazy about carbonated drinks considering the current discussion about certain negative side effects that may be caused by carbonation in general.  You really can't put fresh fruit in a canned drink.  For those of you who are interested in a nutritious fruit drink that is good for you, take some frozen grapes, strawberries or cherries and put them in a smoothie blender.  Add some grape juice, apple juice, cranberry juice or whatever you have (that is 100% fruit product), some kiwi and pineapple (if you like), a banana (if you want some thickness) and some ice.  Blend and then pour in a nice ice cold glass and enjoy!  Now this is 100% naturally good for you.  Nice try Switch - but I'd rather switch."
2,I ordered this one and the salmon but I got two salmon instead. I bet this one would be good if I ever got it.
1,"I am a  big fan of carbonated soft drinks and juice drinks. So while I strongly disliked the Switch Black Cherry flavor, I wanted to keep an open mind to Switch Kiwi Berry. While I started off with an open mind, after drinking most of the can I wished I kept a closed mouth. I found the carbonation level to be satisfactory, but I felt the so-called Kiwi Berry flavor could be summed up in one very technical term -- Yuck! Not only was the flavor bad going down, it left a lingering unpleasant aftertaste. Further, the 8.3 fl oz drink is high in total carbs (34g), sugar (33g) and calories (135). My overall opinion of this product is the same as it was for the Black Cherry variety -- i.e., it is not worth drinking even for free (as I did thanks to the Vine program). If these observations don't turn you off, drink up and enjoy!"
1,"For a beverage that is basically 100% fruit juice that has been carbonated, with no sweetners or preservatives added, Switch Orange Tangerine pretty much tasted to me like a can of Orange Crush or Sunkist soda.<br /><br />That isn't a bad thing, per se...but it was not something I would pay a premium for if I were in the mood for orange soda.  Presumably, it is a little bit healthier than a straight soda, but it is nothing special to taste, and thus I will not go through the effort to seek it out.<br /><br />(On the other hand, my 16 year old daughter claimed to like it MORE than orange soda, and in fact said that she felt she could taste the grape juice in it.  As with many juices, even though it is orange ""flavored""...grape juice is a major ingredient.  So she would give it four stars.)"
4,"This product does not smell very well to me.  In fact, I have to use a fork to ""tenderized"" the pieces for my old kitty cat."
3,"Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla<br />""cocoa.""  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe<br />what you read, right?<br />I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br /><br />It kind of makes me think of baby formula...........the other reviewer who said like a hot vanilla<br />milkshake is close to describing it but it is not creamy enough in my opinion to qualify as such.....<br /><br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and<br />clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~"
1,"Taste is good enough to maybe purchase a 24-pack of this sugar-free, 100% juice carbonated orange / tangerine flavored drink. With more folks (like myself) these days seeking out sugarless soft drinks, this Switch product is actually quite good, I thought. Easy and small enough to carry. Might want to bring two. Ideal for a summer night outing at a theater in the park event, friend's outdoor bar-b-que, kids softball game, etc."
0,"A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed. The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years.<br /><br />I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon!) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away. The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally).<br /><br />This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend."
2,My kids love this soup and I love having a few on hand. It's a reliable meal with some toast and cheese. I often add tofu to it to bump up the protein and they never notice.
0,"While not the finest Earl Grey out there, it sure is packaged for maximum appeal.  The petite cylindrical canister  is sized just right for glorified-spice-rack tea cabinet storage, with artwork that's just short of overwrought. Pop off the top, and lo: it's double-hulled, requiring an extra bit of effort for each pot brewed.  Special!  This second satisfying-pop comes complete with a wallop of sharp, nose-tingling bergamot.<br />Regular tea drinkers may find Rishi's Earl Grey most suitable as garnish to a darker, fuller-bodied tea (a couple of spoons on top of some PG Tips makes for a nice afternoon pick-me-up). Otherwise they may find they go through a can a week, at best.<br /><br />Alone, this tea brews to an orangeish hue, no darker, and always tastes slightly understeeped, or overmilked.  I tried to oversteep, but no dice: It's as if the tea's been neutered, the merest hint of tannin erased. It's unnerving.<br /><br />If you want a tea that will pretty much always present pretty well, and are willing to pay extra for that pritnear peace of mind, Rishi's Earl Grey is a good bet.  If you like more involvement with your tea -- attention to leaf volume, water temperature, steeping time, ratio of additives, etc. -- stick with Twinings, Numi, or Taylors of Harrogate."
4,"All 3 of my cats including the skittish/picky kitten adore these treats! My high-anxiety kitten hides all of the time and won't eat these same treats in the Milk flavor, but she always comes out and eats these Seafood treats! Couldn't be happier!"
0,The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes.
0,My whole family is addicted to this tea.  We make it in our Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker - it's fabulous!
3,"All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior."
1,"I received a couple of samples of these at a food service show recently and was pretty impressed. Kiwi berry was my favorite, sweet but not too sweet and the sparkling water kicks it up. The orange tangerine was very tasty as well, I am a fan of delicious flavor. They have no added sugar, but still plenty (29 grams) of sugar that naturally occurs in the fruit concentrate the juice is made from...versus 39 grams in a can of regular Coke. My go-to juice drink is still Fruit 66, but the Switch is a very close second!"
2,I have two.  I like this product for a few reasons and dislike it for only one reason.  This is a good product because it gives you perfect 2oz portions.  It is easy to clean and store and fit in the freezer.  The only down side is that the plastic scent is a bit strong and sometimes the food scent stays on it even after I wash it in the dishwasher.  Maybe it is because I do not take them out once they freeze and place them in ziplock bags.  I just leave the food in and take 1 or 2 out at a time.  I still make and store my little one her apple sauce even though she is a finger food baby and not a puree baby anymore.  I still use this product and recommend it.
4,My cat will eat NOTHING but Whiskas Beef in Gravy cat food. Being able to order and receive it through the mail has been a blessing. I get it for my mom because she cannot drive to the store because of her health issues. Its great not to have the extra burden of getting cat food. Her cat is her companion through hard times.
1,"I bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because I see it everywhere. It was nasty. I will never drink this crap again, I don't care how ""good"" it is for you. The taste is disgusting and I'd rather just drink regular water. Blah!"
4,"They LOVE it, I give my kitties (Silki and Tuffy) half a pouch each as a mid day snack to keep thier bird terrorizing energy level up.I gave it 4 stars only because it's a little messy to tear open sometimes, and I don't use scissors because you have to clean them afterwards. Oh Well, they DO love it."
2,"My son and I are allergic to sesame, so these nutritious little seeds are a good alternative. They're great to add to homemade crackers or even to pasta dishes. Everyone in the family likes them. The reason for 4 stars is that there are some black hulls mixed in that are pretty hard and get stuck in our teeth."
2,"It's been a month or so since I read the other reviews but if I remember, some found them to be a bit messy to eat. I haven't had any problems, even when keeping a box on top of the fridge where it tends to get a little warm,, but the piece of plastic coated cardboard that covers the peanut side peeled off cleanly without any peanut butter sticking to it and I had no problems eating the peanut butter coated thin.  Would not recommend taking with you in your purse on a hot day as a snack however as I suspect they would get gooey if at higher than normal temperatures.  I just signed up for 1 month subscription so I won't run out...I did run out the first time and I missed them so now I'll have enough to last a month.  When I bought the first order, I couldn't find them in local stores but haven't looked lately since I'm using Amazon's subscription program.  Note that a single packet serving is not much food.  But I'm trying to control sugar intake and I have not found myself eating more than one at a time.  Maybe because the foil packet isn't the easiest to get off (not a problem) and it's not like caramel corn or Oreos where I can keep eating so many that I don't realize it until the package is empty.  I would recomment."
4,"I used to buy this at Target but it's cheaper at Amazon.<br /><br />My cat goes crazy when I get out the bag so I know she loves it. Cheap to boot, also!<br /><br />I don't really stress out about which exact ingredients are in cat or dog food. I figure it's all pretty decent so why not save a little money..."
0,I love this tea - bold and smooth. I love the fact that you can use the tea leaves for more than one steep. It really makes it go a long way. I will be getting this again!
0,"There are some types I really like--especially Southern Sweet Tea (which is actually a lot less sweet than Southerners really make it).  The raspberry and peach are also good, and not overly sweet.  Urologist has banned artificial sweeteners from me as they do kidney damage.<br /><br />I did not care for the herbals, and thought there was a bit too much green tea in the assortment--but I found friends who like those flavors.<br /><br />It was to taste test, and it was fine for that.  I don't think I will buy assortments again, as I have found what I really like."
0,"Hibiscus Tea 24 Bags, I've got this tea for my Dad to help him with his Blood Pressure, it is a little early to tell. I also taking it myself, I like all kinds of Tea, Green, Triple Leaf Tea, this one has a very deep purple color and nice Fruity Flavor, I really like it. Hibiscus Tea is the combination of two herbs. Hibiscus is cultivated throughout the tropics, its flowers are highly prized for making Jams, Jellies, sauces and Beverages<br /><br />Lemongrass is a sub-tropical herb known for its strong citrus flavor and aroma. It became a popular edition to Tea blends in the 1970s and was quickly accepted in Europe. By blending these tropical flavours together, they have created a tart and fruity Tea that is Kid friendly and truly wonderful hot or cold. I also like the fact that this Tea does not contain any Caffeine, that usually keeps me up, no problem with Hibiscus Tea. It tastes Great! Thank You"
0,"The first thing you notice when you open a tin of Twinings Lady Grey<br /><br />(beside the redolence of bergamot oil mixed with the aroma of black tea and lemon which is a staple of the *Earl* Grey Teas) is the striking visual pattern of the loose tea:<br /><br />Dark dry tea leaves sprinkled with bright dots of dry orange peel and stunningly-blue cornflower petals.  It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl, this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost 5 years now.<br /><br />Note that unlike Earl Grey, *Lady Grey* seems to be a Trademark of the Twinings Co.  If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings, you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent.  For example, some other companies market a blend called ""Pouchkine"" or ""Afternoon Earl Grey"" which essentially are milder versions of the traditional Earl Grey and lack some proprietary Twinings-only ingredients (most notably, the cornflowers)."
0,Reality strikes.  I have been drinking this tea every night for 10 years !  It is the best thing to keep me on the straight n narrow!
0,"This product is great. I have been searching for an easy to use and non sweetened green tea. So many of the teas are sweetened with Splenda type sweeteners and I prefer to use Stevia. The Jackie Chan green tea appears to have been discontinued.<br /><br />I mix this product and love the taste. A little lemon and Stevia and I have the perfect evening iced tea. It provides all the benefits of green tea, and the instant convenience.<br /><br />I give it five stars"
1,"I decided to get this for my 7 yr old son to try to deter him from sugary drinks. Well this was pinkish and fizzy and looked nice, I took a sip and it kind of tasted like cough syrup lol...however HE LOVED IT. He wanted more...I did read the caloric content and ingredients and honestly it isnt any healthier than a soda! I will have to say that he did love it and I had ordered another flavor that he loved as well."
0,"this is a great tea. if you are familiar w/ the tea that Aveda used to make, you will be pleasantly surprised at this VERY similar and cheap product. needs no sweetner (and i am a tea w/ sugar person) and is caffeine free tea too. it is D-LISH!"
0,This tea is ok but it's not nearly as potent as the original product that was available 5-10? Years ago.
0,"This variety pack is great. It comes with my favorite flavor, Earl Grey tea. Amazing aroma it has and with a Stroopwafel nothing can be better in the morning. The other flavors are nice too. Lady Grey for instance has a mild citrus flavor.<br /><br />Buying in bulk from Amazon saves money too. So if you're into Twinings or tea for that matter, this is a great deal."
3,"At my house, we call it Hot Vanilla.  This is the BEST hot chocolate-type drink I've ever tasted.  I am a lifelong chocoholic, but now I order Stephen's French Vanilla by the case because all the others pale in comparison, and I just don't want them anymore.  You won't regret springing for a case of it.  Makes a terrific gift too. Mmmmmmm......"
3,"I have tried these and this is a very good mix, I add more chocolate chips and they were very chewy and moist."
0,"I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays ""NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS"" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays ""CAFFENE FREE"".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it."
2,FIRST!!!1!!!!!!11!!  that's all i really wanted to say.<br /><br />but this looks disgusting.  i don't know about you but i really don't like eating like an astronaut orphan.
3,"Funny thing - I bought some of these K-cups several weeks ago based on the strength of the reviews at that time.  I just got them last week and have had a few cups since then.  I'm using 8 ounces of water to prepare the cocoa.  I thought they tasted pretty good - reasonably chocolaty and smooth.<br /><br />They were sweet, but not overly so, and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box.  60 calories - hey, not too bad!  It wasn't until now that I came back to place a review and I read the most recent reviews from others did I realize they use artificial sweetener.  Honestly, if I hadn't read it I would have never known - I didn't detect anything that gave me the hint when I drank it.<br /><br />I think if you like a quick cocoa on the run you'll be happy enough with these K-cups.  Are they as good as a Swiss Miss packet from Costco?  Maybe not, but in my office I don't want to deal with getting powder on the counters and needing a spoon to get things mixed.  You'll sacrifice a little for the convenience, but to me it's well worth it."
4,"This food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a Thanksgiving day dinner!  I was impressed with it when I opened the can, and my cats were when they ate it.  It contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey...not too big, making it easy for my kitties to eat.  They have gotten the Tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when I would try to break them up.  Not this, I just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there.  There is liquid around the sides of the food in the center, but the meat/vege mix in the middle is well packed.  I didn't feel like I was getting more liquid than food, like Halo foods so I was happy about that as well.  Plus, through amazon, this is a great price for this quality food."
1,"Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff!"
1,Grapes are very sweet.  Adding more Grape Juice Concentrate to sweeten the juice is overdoing it.  I wished Kedem would stop making a good product bad.
0,"I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:<br /><br />1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);<br /><br />2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know it's green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and<br /><br />3) if you're going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
4,The product itself was inedible and mostly crumbs. It even smelled bad. The star is there because of the packing material. My cats LOVED the packing material. Played in it for days. I'd almost buy the product again for that packing material.
1,"NO sugar added, No preservatives, 100% juice carbonated. This is what is written on the can of this ""soda juice."" The taste was good and you are basically getting what it says. take some juice add some carbonation and thats what you have here. both my kids took a few sips and they enjoyed it. the cans are great for little hands to hold. my 18 month old was able to grasp it just fine since it is slim. overall a good drink."
2,A nice blend of several different fruits. This stage 3 food was tasty. Not as thick as some other stage threes and there are no bites or chunks. It is more like a thin custard. My son always loved this.
3,This hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products.  We tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we'll be going back to the cafe escapes brand.
4,my finicky cats wouldn't eat this food so I gave it to my neighbor who rescues cats so the food wouldn't go to waste...
0,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>Earl Grey is one of my favorite teas. Rishi Earl Grey Tea is good, aromatic and flavorful. The tea is not that strong for an Earl Grey, definitely not bold, but it is strong enough (just add another tablespoon to make it stronger). I steeped this tea for a long time (forgot about it) and it never became that bitter (I never add anything to my tea). It never felt strong or bold for that matter. The taste is long lasting though. Borrowing from the wine world, it has a long finish. The tea has a faint yellow ring in the cup and a brownish-orangy color.<br /><br />The tea is very aromatic and the container contains an extra lid to keep the aroma and freshness of the tea.<br /><br />It is a bit overpriced but, at least you can reuse the leaves a few times. This is also a fair trade organic product.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy the video. Please let me know if you want any more info."
1,"I didn't care for this drink at all.  It's almost like eating a sweettart in liquid, carbonated form.  My husband and oldest daughter felt the same way, but my 13 year old liked it.  It is 100% juice though, which is nice to see in a carbonated beverage."
3,"When I was talking to a neighbor about getting a Keurig she told me not to get cocoa.  This was in a group of beverages that I got when I ordered my Keurig and I think it is very good.  It is rich, creamy, and exactly what I want when I want a cup of cocoa!  I would order this again."
1,"This is not a bad product, just an average one. It's carbonated fruit juice so it's certainly a better choice than soda, and contains 100% of your vitamin C for the day. But, the taste is nothing special -- strong on the strawberry flavor and sweeter than you would expect from juice.<br /><br />The price is rather steep once you figure in the per-ounce cost. I would rather have regular juice, skip the carbonation, and skip the high price. But, if you're trying to wean the kids off sugary soda, this is something worth considering -- they get the carbonation and sweetness of soda, but not the corn syrup and other junk."
3,"This product is, in fact, a spiced, chocolate drink.<br /><br />It is yummy.<br /><br />It is not super-chocolatety, but it does have enough chocolate flavor to warrant it being labeled a chocolate drink.  It *is* very sugary, but what reasonable person believes that a chocolate drink should be anything other than a treat?<br /><br />I give it four stars because while very yummy, it does not send my consciousness into the higher stratosphere of the realm of pure, abstract deliciousness.  It is, however, a product I will purchase again.<br /><br />It tastes sweet, cinnamony, and chocolatey and has some other flavors I cannot identify.  I recommend it if you like or are curious about such things."
1,"Small can of tasty though very sweet carbonated soft drink.  You need to have a sweet tooth, but if you do, you'll love it.  The can is small, 8.3 oz, but it seems sufficient, given the sweetness.  Goes well on ice.  The fruity combination of flavors works well.<br />Recommended.  There are 36g of carbs."
1,"I really didn't think there was anything special about this product. It doesn't have a bad taste, but it is different than a regular orange flavored soda. It is definitely not as sweet (which isn't a bad thing for me as I find the orange sodas way too sweet) and left a tiny bit of an odd aftertaste. It is a healthier alternative to regular sodas as there is no high fructose corn syrup, but it was still just as caloric. It is juice rather than artificial syrups, but the first juices listed in the ingredients are the overly sweet apple and grape constitutes, not orange and tangerine, to make the drink taste sweeter I suppose. Honestly, considering the price of this product and the lukewarm impression it left on me, I would rather just pour my own juice blend and add soda water or sparkling water to it myself. Most juices seem to be vitamin C fortified themselves, so unless you are just looking to replace the artificial sodas with something less damaging, I can't see a big benefit to this product."
1,IT SAYS ON THE BOX EACH DRINK CONTAINS: THE POTASIUM OF 2 BANANAS & MORE ELECTROLITES THAN A SPORTS DRINK. THEY MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE HIGH PRICED BUT GO TO GROECERY STORE BUY 2 BANANAS & 2 SPORTS DRINKS AND YOU WILL PAY MORE TO GET THE SAME NUTRITION YOU GET FROM 1 JUICE BOX OF THIS COCONUT WATER...
2,"I really like the Happy Baby ""Chick Chick"" pouches and thought this would be a great way to introduce seafood to our baby. However, the consistency is much different - much thicker than the chicken pouch, and the smell! Well you definitely know it's seafood! It reminds me much too much of cat food.<br /><br />All is not lost - our little guy would eat it, provided I dunked each bite in some pureed sweet potato or squash first. But, I don't think we'll be buying this flavor again."
4,"My cats (7 of them) love this food so I was glad to see Amazon is carrying it again. The local stores do not carry a 15 lb bag, only the 3.5lbs and 12 lbs. This food is sealed very well, and is fresh. I have tried expensive brands and really cheapo brands of cat food, and so far 9 lives agrees very well with my cats. This food does not ""rifle"" through them or cause overly offensive litter pan odors (like cheapo cat food) and their digestive and urinary tracts are all healthy. My cats ages range from 3 years to 18 years old, and believe me, this 9 Lives brand and flavor are something they all like. The price is a really good deal especially for prime as the shipping is free.<br /><br />I also buy the Iams in the orange bag for my cats for a variety and putting some of that in a bowl dry as well as wetted down with water in another bowl is something they really love. Again, no intestinal issues or litter pan issues as they have been eating this combination for several years now.<br /><br />If you do try this, or switch your cat(s) over, be patient as it may take a week or so for your cats digestive system to adjust. In the end, I think you will be very pleased with the quality and price.<br /><br />Also, we used to take in foster cats, and fed them this 9 Lives brand, and they all did very well."
2,"I generally consider Keebler products to be definitely designed for children, and not appealing to adult sensibilities.  I bought these on chance because I love mint flavored products and they were on sale.  I fully expected to find them gagging and that I would have to give them away.<br /><br />Surprisingly they aren't bad.  I wouldn't buy them again, since there are so many similar products which are better.  But they have good points.  Each bar is large, not as big as a candy bar, but close.  Each bar is individually wrapped, which I thought was overkill for a box of cookies, but that makes it easy to throw one into a lunch box or purse.  Note that you only get six cookies in the whole box.  The cookies are surprisingly light and crispy.  Definitely sweet, but not overly so, unlike many other Keebler products.  The mint flavor is fresh and not wimpy, and the chocolate flavor is mild but still pleasant.  The flavors overall are well balanced with emphasis on the mint, as it should be.<br /><br />I'm not sure if these are designed for children or adults.  They seem much too large to be meant for children, and I'm not sure if kids would enjoy this combination of flavors in this configuration."
2,"Baby loves this.  She is 14 months old and I scoop it into her bowl and she feeds herself.  I love that it is salmon, which I don't buy for the family, so she is eating healthier than we do! It would be nice it this food were a little easier removed from the package to ensure getting every ounce of goodness, but still love the pouches better than other packages for travel and storing ease.  My older children are always asking to have some of the baby's food."
1,"Bitters go in and out of style.  They are only called for in a few drinks (or food dishes) but are just imperative for an Old Fashioned or Manhattan.  Bitters are certainly a matter of taste, but this brand is considered by many to be the gold standard.<br /><br />The House of Angostura has a long and storied history, and a shortage of bottles a few years ago put their product in short supply, probably worsened by hoarding.  Angostura is back, with its famous oversized labels, but it is absent from most local shelves, so Amazon is a reliable source.<br /><br />A bottle this size will last me a lifetime, and I just might mention it in my will."
2,These are the only organic grahams I can find for a reasonable price.  We LOVE these and Amazon makes them a perfect affordable snack for my toddlers.
0,"The tea tastes great and helped me curb cravings during dieting. The tea was inexpensive and came packaged in a pretty box. The bags are flimsy, but I just throw the bag in a tea ball with no worries. I will continue to keep this on hand as part of my tea collection."
4,"I first learned bout Tiki Cat while searching for responsible and healthy food for my cats. I tried many different brands of cat food before Tiki Cat. I knew I had a hit when even my finiky cat came running for Tiki Cat food time. They seem to like the Sardines best, but I'm sure that every cat is different, and Tiki Cat has so many varities you're sure to find one your cat likes. Amazon has the cheapest price for this product, and it's delivered right to my door! I'll never have to drive to a pet store and pay extravagent prices for good cat food again!"
4,"I wanted a treat that was accepted and well liked for my rescue animals.<br />This is the only treat that is healthy and loved by all 4 legged beings in my home!<br />It does not contain sugar or grains or silly vegetables which virtually all treats contain. Dogs, cats and ferrets are carnivores they are not cattle to eat grain or rabbits to eat vegetables, and WHYYYY do companies add sugar,beet pulp or corn syrup to carnivore foods? It is dangerous and can cause the death of an animal with diabetes.<br />It is pretty easy to break into smaller pieces for cats and kittens with weak jaws and its wonderful to use as an aid to gain the trust of an abused dog as it will not cause stomach upset when given in common sense amounts.<br />I like that it goes a long way as it costs alot to heal and maintain and train abused and rescued dogs.<br />NO minus to this product other then the price,I can not afford to use it as much as I would like."
2,My 12 month old loves this salmon.  These containers are great for traveling and make easy meals!
4,"The cats like this stuff pretty well, for the health of our felines we keep them on an all-canned food diet. This is one of their favorite flavors, I will admit that sometimes you can see bits of fish bone in the can, but the food seems to be of high quality. I wish Amazon woudl carry the organic versions of petguard canned food for cats."
2,Anyone searching for stage 3 of gestational banana trajectories would be well advised to procure this item immediately.  It is an essential purchase.  That is all.
3,As you know finding a hot chocolate that taste great and is brewed on the keurig is a big challenge. Well this hot chocolate is quite good. The flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it. I made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it.  Will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder.
3,"Even after shaking the cup and only using 6 ounces of water, this ""hot cocoa"" (pretty sure there's not a lick of real chocolate in it) still tastes horrible."
4,I wanted this for the omega 3's but my daughter wouldn't eat this.  It really smells and looks like cat food.
3,"I recommend this instead for the same price: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HD0PEQ"">Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix, Milk Chocolate, 16-Count Envelopes (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />This thing falls short, I found myself adding some milk or my non-dairy creamers to my cup of this to make it taste somewhat creamy.  It more or less tastes horrible otherwise.  After I hated it, I decided to make it with a cup of hot milk, I just decided to pour it into a hot cup of milk, and it tastes so much better.  In my opinion, they need to up the powdered milk in them, or the non-dairy creamer in them.  It would improve this product so greatly.<br /><br />They are thieves nonetheless, you usually get 10 envelopes of hot cocoa that tastes better than this in the supermarket for less than five bucks, buy two for less than ten, and still be spending less than what I spent with these.  I really thought I was buying quality, this is definitely not unless I use milk which is like cheating myself and spending extra money.  I've drank common hot cocoa from supermarket straight with water that tasted way better than this.<br /><br />AVOID!"
0,I found out that I really like chai tea.  The double chai spice is amazing.  These teas are full of flavor and come fresh and packaged well.
3,I love hot chocolate but don't drink milk: this is THE BEST hot chocolate I've tasted using just plain water.
1,"This is a great way to trick children into drinking ""juice"", it is organic, flavorful and the berries give the tea a red/pink/purple color.  No more food coloring, artificial flavors or sweeteners.  Everything I could have asked for.  Even the packaging is Green, it is printed with soy ink.  This is a company you should be proud to support.  The only way it could be better is if it was made in my home town, so it would take less energy to get it into my tummy.  It is absolutely refreshing and nourishing."
1,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
2,"The other reviews are very outdated & old. We never had any issues with the quality of this product. My daughter loved it; I loved the fact that she was getting good protein. Most of the other earth's best baby foods have carrot/squash/sweet potatoes, which is fine, however my daughter was turning orange from so many orange veggies. I liked that this one had NO orange veggies in the ingredient list. Slightly more expensive than other meals, which I think is due to the fact it has a lot of meat in it."
0,"Twinings developed this tea last year (2006) for their 300th anniversary - a counterpart to their famous ""Earl Grey"" product.  ""Lady Grey"" has the distinctive Earl Grey flavor but with just a hint of floral.  It has become my family's favorite tea.  We can no longer get it in our stores but is easily available on-line from Twinings.  Buy it - maybe we'll get it back in our stores!  A wonderful product!"
3,My box of Grove Square Hot Cocoa arrived today and I've just tried it. Delicious. Made a big cup [by mistake] but I'm happy with the flavor and consistency.  No off tastes that I can discern.  A little disappointed at high sodium content. Nice to have as fall starts to chill.
4,"This is an extremely high quality cat food that tastes (according to the cats) as good as it looks. I have seven (yes, seven) cats, all rescues who have become spoiled brats and who enjoy being difficult to please. They didn't care for all of the Fussie Cat flavors, but the tuna with shrimp and the tuna with salmon were both big hits and we stocked up.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to have a food of this quality to feed them!"
2,"I'm pregnant, and lately have been craving foods from my childhood (like peanut butter sandwiches, barbecue chips, apple juice). I've been in a soup mood lately and bought a bunch of Amy's soups at Whole Foods. This soup is light and delicious, and tastes like spaghetti O's! Of course it is more soup-like and healthier, but that's what this reminded me of!"
3,"This has a very dark chocolate flavor that mixes quickly and smoothly in hot water. No chucks like most of the other brands. Milk chocolate is fine for those who enjoy that but for real chocolate lovers that enjoy the true flavor of dark chocolate, don't miss this."
0,"When it comes to Earl Grey, I am a fan of ""sharp"" ones, like Williamson Tea, but this tea is extremely good! It has a bit smoky and oily aftertase that is very mild and lingers for a while. A second brew is especially enjoyable. Plus it's USDA Organic and Fair Trade Certified. I like it more than Two Leaves And A Bud's Earl Grey. I highly recommend this tea!<br /><br />3.5 months later: I have finished a 3rd can of this delicious loose tea and am going to buy more! Excellent stuff!"
3,"I had the pleasure to taste the real deal in Mexico.  I loved it.  When I came home I sought out the real deal here in the states, I guess I did not look very far but I did come up with this pretty good substitute.  I also like the other brand of Mexican chocolate, I tried them side by side and they are almost exactly the same.<br />I love the texture and I often, more than not, eat it just the way it is right from the package.  But to make a good Mexican cocoa you need to use a paddle and put the chocolate in the cup, pour over the hot milk and paddle it till it is melted and foamy.  You do not need to microwave it, yuck!  You do not have to put it in the blender, Mexican people, for the most part, do not use blenders for their hot cocoa.  I buy it at the store it is too expensive here."
2,"We love Happy Baby products - cereals, puffs, yogurt melts, all the baby food - EXCEPT Gobble Gobble. Even my 3 year old choked on this. It really ticked me off when my 1 year old choked too! It is EXTREMELY dry and thick and lumpy. I cannot believe Happy Baby manufacturers and sells this stuff, and I can't believe retailers stock it. DO NOT BUY!"
0,"This tea is very tasty. I drink one cup of hot tea in the morning and at night, with a little honey and equal. Makes me very relaxed and calm."
0,This is by far the best green tea I have ever had and at a price much lower than that of a local grocery store.  I have ordered more.
0,I was introduced to Taj Mahal by an Indian women who used it as the base for a wonderfully flavored chai using mostly ginger and cardamom.  I have been a fan ever since.  It is strong - only for strong black tea drinkers.
4,"Not exactly sure whether it really mediate hairball issue because my short hair Russian Blue rarely vomits while my mixed medium hair toby vomits quite frequently, regardless of the treat. Nevertheless, my cats do love it greatly, always rushing to me whenever I grab it."
0,"Prince of Tea brand teas are great. The premium oolong tea is good, but I found that I like their organic oolong to taste better than the premium, and it generally costs less too. Prince of Tea is a well known and environmentally concious company and you'll do well to buy their products."
4,My cat is a very picky eater. This is the best price around and the best food too! MY Cat goes GAGA over it!
3,This Hot chocolate is very good. It has just the right amount of milk chocolate flavor. The price is a very good deal and more than worth it!
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry tastes metallic and fake.  Neither my wife nor I could finish off the can because the flavor was so off.  The Watermelon Strawberry flavor was much better.  I couldn't identify any kiwi flavor at all, and the berry flavor did not taste like any berry I have ever eaten.  In fact, strawberry is the very last of the juice concentrates listed.  They mixed apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juices together.  I think having just one juice flavor would have been better because this mix was just bizarre.  Also, the drink contains 135 calories per 8.3 ounce serving.  At that rate, I'd rather have a Coke if I want carbonation or regular juice if I want something fruit flavored."
4,"I was really disappointed in these olives. The are very mushy and I prefer a more firm texture. Cat Cora's olives are much, much better."
0,"Really good ""Organic tea"".... im not a tea person(well hot tea anyway) but this tea comes in a lot of new and interesting flavors that changed my attitude on hot tea. still love coffee though"
0,"Harney & Sons' Dragon Pearl Jasmine tea is one of the cleanest and most delicate of commercially-available teas I've encountered.<br /><br />My first experience with it was at the Williamsburg Lodge, in Virginia, where it was served over the 3 days of an annual convention I attend there.  While a shame to have to sip it standing up or moving between speaker sessions, I had a remarkable sense of being elevated above the rush around me.  The bouquet is evocative and tended to linger in the air yet was in no way overpowering... more like a stroll through a jasmine-studded garden.  Upon tasting, the first impression seems to register near the tip of the tongue, as if sweet, and as the flavor develops in the mouth there is a recognition that it is, in fact, tea but without insistent tannic or other strong overtones.  A fine impression remains when the cup is set down and the intake of breath recharges the sensation.<br /><br />There is no settling of heavy flavors-- a cup is as fine and pleasurable from first sip to last.  I also have found that this tea maintains its character despite the array of waters I have used to make it.  Some brews become distinctly unpleasant when the leaves are introduced to certain mineral-rich well water or treated city water.  The best experience no doubt is when using filtered water, but it is not requisite to enjoying Jasmine Pearl.<br /><br />As a wake-me-up tea on a work morning, I would likely choose a more robust leaf.  However, for a proper moment of relaxation-- or an attempt to induce one in the midst of chaos!-- I hope to never run out of this tea."
4,"My two cats used to love this formula, but I guess they got tired of it, or maybe the formula was changed ... I only feed it occasionally now."
2,I used to buy Gerber baby foods and was thrilled when they started carrying organic foods. Then I discovered that they add gelatin! Why? It is disgusting and has absolutely no nutritional value.  I will not be buying Gerber products again. Earth's Best is actually organic.
3,"This is very high quality cocoa powder, with high cocoa butter content.  It makes excellent hot chocolate, brownies, mochas, and frosting.<br /><br />It is not Dutch process, so it is suitable for most uses which do not explicitly call for Duch process cocoa.<br /><br />It ships in a durable and resealable plastic bag, and stays fresh and dry for months."
0,"i first tried this tea in a hotel room in san diego and never forgot it.  checked it online and was happy to find amazon had much better prices than if bought from the company.  it doesn't come in the cute, individually wrapped boxes but it's still the same great tasting green tea."
0,I tried many teas and thought would try this kind. Saw it on Dr. OZ show. Didn't like its taste.
4,"I feed prowl because it is a high quality healthy food that does not break my budget.  It is much cheaper than other premium wet foods (Wellness, Weruva, etc), and my cat seems to like it.  The only downside to prowl is that, since it is dehydrated, you must mix it with water and wait 10 minutes before serving.  My kitten meows at me the entire time.<br />I started my cat on Prowl because my vet offered a free sample. She ate it right away with no problems.  However, she'd only ever had ""healthy"" food, so I was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled (but addictively tasty) food.<br />It is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems.  I recommend (like another reviewer) that you order a free sample and give it a try."
3,"Everyone I've given these to enjoys these very much.  I prefer the dark chocolate ones myself, but I made a mistake and ordered the milk chocolate.<br /><br />I cannot eat them as I am allergic to milk, but my husband, guests, and co-workers are enjoying these healthy alternatives to candy bars."
2,I bought this product for my daughter for christmas. It came pre-grown and moistened in its container. She was very happy!
2,"I have tried many different flavors from many different brands and by far, this particular flavor from Happy Baby is the worst texture and taste that I ever bought for my baby.  My baby just doesn't like it.  I let her try it three times and she just hates the texture and the taste.  I don't why they made the food so dry to begin with.  Turkey itself gives a little dried texture compared to chicken and they should have taken that into consideration.  And the food is so lumpy and it's not even in good chunky blend either.  In the end it was a total waste of money to buy this product."
0,"In an effort to reverse augmenting high blood pressure, a physician recommended I drink hibiscus herbal tea. Kudos to Celebration Herbals for delivering the tea one day after the order was placed. I followed instructions on the box and used spring water which was  steeped for approximately ten minutes. Although the primary reason for drinking the tea was medicinal, I also wanted a flavorable tea. Sadly the taste of the tea was unexceptional. Accordingly, the next box of hibiscus tea that I purchase will not be from Celebration Herbals."
4,"I've been feeding Wellness grain free for a couple years now with great results for my 3 cats. I believe the cost of a top quality food is well worth it in healthy, happy cats and reduced vet bills, but still the cost of Wellness has been prohibitive. I was excited to see Felidae had a grain free formula in the larger sized cans, and for a much lower price, so I am trying it. Just switched them over this week, so far so good. The bowls have been licked clean, and while I questioned the whole peas when I saw them, they weren't left in the bowl. The ingredients and quality of the Felidae seems comparable to the Wellness, so unless I find information indicating otherwise (and I've been looking), I think we'll stick with Felidae."
0,Some people mentioned the loose tea is difficult to filter.<br /><br />USE A FRENCH PRESS made for coffee is a good option - dilute concentrate to desire strength. My favorite flavors are: Mango and Passion Fruit.
3,My husband is a huge fan of hot cocoa.  I surprised him with a 6-pack of Stephen's Peanut Butter Cup Hot Cocoa.  It actually has little peanut butter cups in it.  They quickly melt into this delicious treat.  We highly recommend this product and will buy it again.
3,"Got a brand new Keurig machine for Christmas and immediately went to work finding the cheapest and best tasting K-Cups on the market. I came across this when searching for some good Hot Cocoa and am amazed at how many K-Cups you really get out of this. 48 K-Cups for about $20 when I purchased was a great deal when most Hot Chocolate prices were 16 K-Cups for $15~$19.<br /><br />This is a great deal and you get to try out Peppermint, Dark Chocolate and Milk Chocolate. It's light on calories and most important of all taste GREAT!<br /><br />Must have if your a Hot Chocolate lover or have family that wants a easy to make, great tasting Hot Chocolate for less!"
0,"My partner is very happy with the tea, and is feeling much better since starting to drink it.<br />She has been drinking it both hot (normal) and iced (chilled) and likes the refreshing nature of it."
0,"I was anticipating a fragrant unprocessed, minimally oxidized tea that is unique to all white teas. This tea could not be farther from that description. Heavily oxidized with a very strong smoky flavor. Not even palatable on a second flush. Please save your money and consider paying a few more dollars from a supplier such as Rishi or Specialteas"
2,"My baby and I both loved the stage 1 Happy Baby pouches that we tried, so I had high hopes for this as well. To my dismay, it smelled like cat food and was gritty. I expected there to be more morsels of food,  but this was just mush. My son took a few bites and refused to eat any more."
4,My cats love this food. For the money it is a great product. I get it every month.  The cats love the flavor.
2,This stuff is fantastic.  My little girl loves it and it gives me the piece of mind knowing that I am not feeding her a huge amount of sugar with mainstream formulas.  Not to mention the other things they have found in them recently.  This is the closest thing to mothers milk.  If your baby spits up a lot you should definitely try this stuff.  My little girl hasn't spit up since I switched ever.  Love it.  Just wish I could buy even more at a time.
0,"This tea actually tastes less 'spicy' than other chais, so the name is almost a bit misleading.  It could be described as more mellow than bold.  But, don't let this deter you if you favor bold teas. The complexity of this tea really works!! It has a wonderfully well balanced and pleasing flavor.  The additional herbs give it an added complexity not found in most chais and even a hint of sweetness. For maximum flavor I recommend steeping this for the full 6 minutes suggested. And, be sure to use two teabags if you're using an extra large mug. Love it!"
0,"My household has this tea stocked up at all times.. not to say it's my favorite tea, but it's my favorite day to day tea. We tend to drink Green Tea for its health benefits and as Green Teas go this one is affordable and fairly high quality for tea bag types. A few notes.. you have to be fairly careful about steeping this tea, it doesn't have a whole lot of tolerance from ""crisp and delicious"" to ""overpowering and slightly off-putting"". I guess I attribute that to the freshness of the tea. I'm not sure. I've had a lot different results with loose tea in a ball and some herbal teas. While this tastes good when you get it right, if you forget the cup for a few minutes, it's not forgiving. That said, that's the only real drawback to this tea. Yes. I've had teas I would rate five stars, six if I could. Yes, they also cost 5-6x more than this easily for a quarter of the amount of tea. Bottom line, if you drink a lot of tea, this is a good brand to buy. If you don't drink a whole lot and would rather buy something really high quality for the few times you do partake of it, I'd look elsewhere."
1,"Switch definitely managed to keep its carbonated juice drink's intended flavor fresh. Though just a combination of sparkling water, the juice concentrates of several fruits (including apples, grapes and oranges) and, oddly enough, soy, it definitely maintains its taste of tangerine.<br /><br />I'd love to see what other flavors Switch has to offer, with my only hesitation coming from ""natural flavors and colors."" But, hey, I'm willing to grant them a little leeway in that department thanks to the NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP!"
1,"UPDATE: April 3, 2009<br />I ""ordered"" this drink through the Vine program based upon the description (see below). I was hoping that it would be what it claimed: ""A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE."" Upon getting this drink I realized that it was actually a fruit juice product, which as such cannot be ""healthy."" Fruit juice consumption is one of the larger contributing/leading causes of weight gain. Therefore the following review is an exposition of why I, along with the dietitians and nurses that I work with at the Veterans Administration, have rated this a one star product.<br /><br />As an avid diet soda drinker who consumes at least 100 ounces per day, I am always looking for alternatives.  Sadly, Switch is anything but that.  Switch is little more than Shasta (TM) non-caffeinated sodas, but with a few more calories!  The ""diet"" drink I was hoping it would be, turned out to be nothing short of ""off the diet.""  As far as I am concerned, Switch is a ""wolf in lamb's clothing"" for those who consider themselves ""heath conscious.""<br /><br />The description, which is rhetoric at its best, states:<br /><br />""The Switch is a great tasting HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE [emphasis added] to soda. The Switch is 100% juice that is carbonated and contains 100% of DV [Daily Value--not Recommended Daily Amount--based on a 2000 calorie diet] of Vitamin C. It has no sugar added and contains nothing artificial. Its just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C. You'll love The Switch because it has the bold taste and nutritional value of a FORTIFIED [emphasis added] juice, with the carbonated refreshment of a soda.  The Switch is 100% of what you want in a soda, and 0% of what you don't[.]""<br /><br />Here is what the label actually provides--again, based upon what they call Daily Value (DV), similar to regular sodas:<br />Serving Size: 8.3 fl oz (245 ml)<br />Servings [per can]: 1<br />Total Fat: 0g  0% DV<br />Sodium: 15mg  1% DV<br />Total Carb: 34g  11% DV<br /> SUGAR [emphasis added]: 33g<br />Protein: 0g  0% DV<br /><br />Then separately listed:<br />Vitamin C: 100%<br /><br />There is no direct indication of the amount of Vitamin C, nor is there any direct indication that the Vitamin C--contrary to their description--is not added; just as the sodium is added.  Since it is listed separately, and other sodas indicate they are NOT a source of Vitamin C, I must conclude that the Vitamin C does not come from the juice, but is added.<br /><br />Relative to the regular soda that I am currently drinking (I grabbed the wrong bottle), Coca-Cola Cherry (TR), Switch Black Cherry has 6g more carbohydrates (listed as ""Carb"" above), but 10mg more sodium--although both amounts are listed as 1% of the Daily Value--than 8oz of the Coca-Cola Cherry (TR) soda pop.<br /><br />As for actual ingredients, here is a comparison of Switch Black Cherry and Coca-Cola Cherry (TR):<br />Switch: 100% JUICE (FILTERED SPARKLING WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE JUICE CONCENTRATES, APPLE, GRAPE, KIWI, ACEROLA, RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY JUICE CONCENTRATES), NATURAL FLAVORS, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C).<br /><br />Coca-Cola (TR): CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CARMEL COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, NATURAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE [23 mg/8 fl oz].<br /><br />Given that acerola is high in Vitamin C, and used in baby foods, I am unsure why ascorbic acid is added to the Switch.  Phosphoric acid is added to soda and other foods to acidify them; that is, to give them a tangy or sour taste--which is derived from the fruit in Switch--at a lower cost that extracting it from fruit.  The carbohydrates in the Switch drink are primarily from the juice, while the corn syrup provides all the carbohydrates in the Coca-Cola (TR).  So, in the end, the only real inexpedience difference in the source of carbohydrates; excluding the added caffeine to this particular soda.<br /><br />That leaves taste.  And to be honest, I prefer sugar substituted soft drinks--and was hoping that Switch would be a way to avoid using sugar substitutes, since some poorly done research suggests that sugar substitutes lead to people consuming more calories (a whole different story, but one I was hoping that Switch would help with).  That said, I must agree with other reviewers that I found the drink to be overly sweet, as did the four other people with whom I shared this drink.  Indeed, I would compare Switch Kiwi with Crystal Light or Sam's Choice with sugar substitute made with too little Club Soda.<br /><br />But drinking Switch MAY BE COOL!?"
4,My two cats love this cat food more than the kirkland signature brand.  It's also very cheap and affordable cat food at walmart. I would recommend this cat food over meow mix or friskies any day.  Get 9lives dry cat food.  It's one of the better brands out there.
0,I drink this delicious tea almost every day.  I have yet to find anything like it on the market.
1,"The carbonation in this drink was way too much. So much in fact, that it over powered the flavor. (Orange-tangerine is usually very good together).  I expect this from a soda, but not a ""healthy"" drink. Lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink. Until then, I'll pass."
2,"I tried this product because it was a ""Friday Special"" and it caught my eye it being 100% fruit and 100% organic.  I don't have any children, but this looked interesting to try because I've been trying to eat healthier and sometimes it's hard to get my recommended amount of fruit servings a day.  I buy fruit but it always seems to go bad before I can eat it all.  I bought the banana mish mash also, and really like it, too.  I like to add it to my oatmeal, or spread it on top of my peanut butter toast, or just by itself!  To clarify the ingredients- it has 3 different fruits, not just peach and not just banana.  Obviously, I'm ok with this...just wanted to throw that out there.  There are multiple things I love about this product.  Here goes.. and not in any particular order...<br />1) Easy to open, convenient, resealable pouch<br />2) It tastes great!<br />3) All natural, 100% fruit...no nasty preservatives or chemicals<br />4) 100% organic<br />5) Great for everyone, not just babies.<br />6) The price is good compared with other similar products, and I love the free shipping!"
1,"This new refreshing drink has no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors and is gluten free !  It provides a convenient container of 8.3 ounces of 100 % tasty juice with plenty of Vitamin C.  If you want a nice afternoon pick-up, you'll enjoy this drink !"
2,"I have a slightly different version of this - different brand.  My son started using it around six months, and he really enjoys it.  He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon, but whatever...  Anyway, I also had trouble cleaning it, until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush.  That works pretty well.  It takes some time, but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender, or cut it up, then clean it up off him, the chair, the floor, the dog, me, well you get the picture."
0,"Lipton loose leaf tea beats any other tea I've tried, hands down. When the local groceries stopped stocking Lipton's Loose Leaf Tea. I assumed Lipton had stopped selling it because tea bags were more profitable, and people found it easier to use tea bags. WRONG, we've been sold on the idea of convenience, and taste took the back seat. This tea is packaged in a foil lined package, is fresher tasting and very consistant in quailty. Make it sweet or unsweet, it does not matter. If you make it too strong, just add water, the flavor is there!  You will be amazed as to how many GALLONS of tea you can make with one box.  You will need to brew it a few times to figure out your formula. It's worth the time!  I live in an area that has very soft water, so I don't need as much product to brew a gallon. It definitely takes more if you have hard water.<br />This is how I brew mine (this may help you get started). Using a Mr. Coffee,(12 cup) Measure 3 Tablespoons (slightly rounded) and place in the filter (just as you would coffee) Fill you crafte to the max, and brew. For sweet tea, I use One and 1/4 cup sugar per gallon. It's  easier to put the sugar in a gallon pitcher, then add the hot liquid. The sugar will dissolve completely, and you won't need as much sugar. When the sugar has dissolved, add water or ice to bring it up to a gallon. If you are not pleased with the outcome try making some adjustments. Once you figure it out. It becomes routine, and is probably one of the the most economial drinks you can make!<br />ENJOY!!<br /><br />PS I keep mine in the freezer in a ziplock, after I've opened the box."
2,I really like the flavor of this hot chocolate.  The kids love the flavor too.  I always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers.  This makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones.  No more powder spilled on the counter tops this way!
0,chamomile tea is great with lemons and Apriva. chamomile tea is caffeine free that's great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure.
0,"i got this tea super cheap and it's pretty good. main point, it's organic! organic and tea and cheap are usually not things that go together. is it gourmet? no. but it's the best i've seen for the price. so for value, five stars, easy. if this was thirty dollars a box however, i would be on here writing a one star review.<br /><br />mild green tea flavor, no grassyness, not a ton of theanine (just guessing by how it makes me feel) but enough. medium caffeine content, on the low end but not non-existent.<br /><br />only complaint, on the package is a picture of a tea cup with what looks like high end gyokuro or something, full leaf leaves floating in it. rip open a bag though and you find dust. not a problem at all really, just silly to put that on the box when that's in no way what's inside."
0,"Yogi Tea's offer high quality tea that taste wonderful.  They offer more complex flavors than traditional grocery store brands, and by purchasing them online, you get excellent prices.  My favorite teas of theirs are Calming and Bedtime.  Both seem to offer wonderful side effects of the feelings of relaxation.<br /><br />If you are not a big tea drinker these are still worth a try.  The flavors are complex and unique.  They are not a single note tea.  I have found these teas to never be bitter, and they are quite good without adding extras to make them taste better.<br /><br />I also like the lovely packaging, and the fortunes included on each tea bag.  I have found their blends to be unique and while I generally prefer bulk tea, that these are my favorite bagged teas.  If you looking for a tea that will help take the load off, give this one a try."
2,"My 7-1/2 month old absolutely loves this one...by far, it is her favorite jarred baby food. I like it because the lentils add a bit more protein than your average baby food, and I'm not ready to introduce her to meats yet.<br /><br />I do subscribe & save, which brings the price down to $0.80/jar. That's a fair price - not an amazing deal, but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocery store.  The bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find - I have to go to Whole Foods. My regular grocery store and Target carry Earth's Best, but not this blend. My daughter likes it so much, though, that I would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices. It's a good one!"
0,"Not all Earl Grey teas are created equal. Because the bergamot oil can mask a less than stellar leaf, many tea companies do not use really high quality tea leaves for their Earl Grey.<br /><br />Rishi uses a solid leaf from Yunnan for their Earl Grey, a hearty black tea which comes from the same region as Puerh tea comes from. As a result you can easily get 2 full steeping from these leaves.<br /><br />The tea has a nice balanced flavor, the bergamot isn't overpowering and it compliments the sweetness of the Yunnan tea. Prior to the Rishi I was purchasing Mighty Leaf's Earl Grey and I have to say that I prefer the Rishi. It all boils down to the choice of tea leaves (which should seem obvious) but Rishi's choice and the price point of this tea make it THE Earl Grey to beat!"
2,"I really do like the Healthy Baby Baby foods.  I buy them with the Amazon Prime free shipping.  I also ""subscribe and save"".  I get 16 at a time.  The baby doesn't mine eating the same flavor each day for 16 days, but at the end of 16 days, he smells like cat food.  Most cats will run at the sound of a can opener, mine have learned to listened for the tearing of the pouch.  If you get this flavor and your baby hates it- you can always use it as cat food.  The texture of this particular product is pretty good for my now 10 month old.  I got a Sprout product with lentils in it and he spit the lentils out.  It is kind of hit and miss with the textures of these foods because their rating has no consistency.  That's my one- and constant- complaint."
4,One of my kitties is a complete snob when it comes to food and she loves this. Great product to buy.
0,"Twinings English Breakfast tea is a good, basic black tea (as is its stronger cousin, Irish Breakfast tea). But I find this loose tea to be a bit of a challenge. It is cut quite finely and no matter how fine the mesh on the infuser or strainer some of this always comes through. I drink a lot of tea and am fine with drinking some tea dust or even a few leaves, but I am talking about a lot of tea here...a teaspoon full or more in each cup.<br /><br />It is true that this tastes better than the bagged variety of Twinings English Breakfast tea. It is smoother and never bitter, as the bagged tea sometimes is. I have compromised and used the loose tea but I strain it through a coffee filter. The tins the tea comes in keep it quite fresh and though straining it is a hassle, it is worth it for me.<br /><br />This is moderately strong (I drink it black) and if you are sensitive to caffeine you might not want to drink it near bedtime. I use Amazon's Subscribe and Save program for this tea; it is a good bargain and I like the convenience of having it delivered. It is also hard to find the loose tea in supermarkets."
1,Nice and sweet. Tastes like strawberry and kiwi. All natural ingredients.<br /><br />I recommend The Switch!
3,"I saw these on sale so I nabbed them.  For anything larger than a 6oz cup, the results will be too weak.  I end up brewing one with 6oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of it.<br /><br />The peppermint was the flavor I was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that I loved the most.  I'm on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k-cups in the future.  It might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my Keurig."
3,This is a very mild hot cocoa.  Perfect for those winter evenings or even good in the morning instead of coffee.  We love it anytime.  Next time I will try the dark chocolate.
0,"Green tea is good for you, loaded with antioxidants, boosts your metabolism, yadda, yadda, yadda, but I never quite warmed up to the taste.  Until now.  The lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor.  And it is SO great that I can just add a packet to my water bottle and go, without the bother of brewing it."
0,"I was recently introduced to Genmai cha by a friend who's husband works for a company that does business with Japan.  I was at once intrigued and desirous to purchase more of the same.  However, I am still unable to find a similar tea with the same delicate taste.  Unfortunately, Yamamotoyama Genmai Cha is just adequate.  I am still on my quest to find that same delicate flavor I found in those tea bags my friend gave me.  Wish me luck in my search!"
0,"This is an excellent tea, very flavorful - the cinnamon is fresh and powerful, and overall it's slightly sweet without needing any sugar. Excellent with milk or straight."
2,"But Fuzzy prefers the salmon primavera to the yellowfin tuna. However, Toto (aka Totolicious) loves it. I have to keep writing until I reach 20"
0,"If you have yet to try rooibos tea you are in for a treat. This smooth delicious tea is excellent any time of the day. I like that rooibos is naturally caffeine free so I can drink it late at night and not worry about staying up all night. I used to drink rooibos when I lived in Africa so this brings back fond memories. What I like most about this tea, besides the flavor, is that this is organic and the company supports fair trade practices. So you can really feel good about drinking a cup of tea from a company that is making the world a better place. This tea is also rich in antioxidants and contains calcium. Some parents make this tea for their children when they have colic (use it like water in baby formula). It is a good natural remedy. This tea does taste best with milk and I add stevia too although it is also served with lemon and honey.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
1,"This product does not claim to be any kind of energy drink, despite the slim can and flashy design.  Instead, it says that it is carbonated fruit juice, and that is exactly what you are going to get!  It is labeled as containing 100% fruit juice by volume, which coincides with the ingredient list.  It is refreshing, new, and something I would consider drinking again.  I leave off the final fifth star, as it was not the most flavorful beverage of the group, but I believe that owes to the fact that there are multiple flavors competing for a spot on your palatte.  Sometimes, one does lose the parts in the whole that way.  Still, I liked it and will definitely drink it again!"
2,"My son started eating this when he was around 8 months old; he's now 14 months old and it's one of his favorites. Unfortunately, they don't carry it at the local grocery store (they carry other varieties of Earth's Best; just not this one or his other favorites, Spinach/Potatoes and Spaghetti with Cheese); they do carry it at some of the Whole Foods so I buy them there. I'm so glad to find them on Amazon! I get TIRED of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the store.<br /><br />We use this as a base and mix in other things - bits of cooked broccoli, small pieces of meat. I've also started adding spices to introduce him to new flavors."
2,"I have been very pleased with this variety pack of baby food. The pack contains three each of pears, peaches oatmeal banana, apples and apricots, and peaches bananas and raspberries. My 6 1/2 month old daughter loves all of them, especially the peaches bananas and raspberries! I have been very satisfied with Earth's best with one exception. The metal lids have a lining that contains BPA (as do ALL lids on glass babyfood jars), so if you're set on staying away from BPA, you'll want to get your baby food from companies that make pouches, like HappyBaby and Plum Organics. I make a lot of my own babyfood, so I feel that feeding her SOME food from glass jars is acceptable, especially for varieties that I can't make. I do also buy a lot of HappyBaby, and I'm very satisfied with the quality there also. All in all though, a very nice variety of good tasting fruits!"
2,"I use these to keep my finicky toddler's protein levels up. What's great, is that they're delicious just about any way you can imagine cooking a sausage!<br /><br />A favorite Recipe: Sautee one large onion, about a tablespoon each dried basil and oregano, and some salt and pepper in about 2T of butter. Add sausage, that's been cut into coins, and russet potatoes cut into 1/4"" thick rounds. Cover all with chicken stock and simmer until potatoes are soft but not dissolved. Throw in a few handfuls of pre-washed baby spinach (I usually use about a half a pound, and frozen would work fine, just put it in a minute earlier). Stir until the spinach is cooked, and then serve! Enjoy!"
3,"The thing I like most about this brand of hot chocolate is that once I remove it from the keurig, it doesn't leak all over the place.  For some reason, all the hot chocolates I've purchased before leak all over when you remove them from the coffee pot.  My coffee doesn't do that so not sure why that is.  This is a great deal for the amount you get as well, and taste yummy!"
3,"I am actually surprised at how good this product is. I am a Cuisinart Keurig owner with two teens that love to drink hot cocoa and cider pretty much year round.<br /><br />Price point: The price for these at the store ( exact brand ) is almost triple of what we pay here for the same amount, with subscribe and save this makes these quite affordable for my family use. In comparison to other more expensive brands it's a great bargain without sacrificing quality over quantity.<br /><br />Flavor wise: My kids love it, and have already asked me to purchase more. My daughter says that the peppermint is right on and not too weak even if using a larger cup. I love the dark chocolate in my coffee to make a mocha ( 10oz coffee to 4 oz chocolate ) and it's much better than some other brands that I have tried in the past.<br /><br />Overall impression:  Great value, good flavor, excellent price point I will be purchasing more."
4,"I've tried it with both my cats, several times. Every time they eat this, and other Whiskas Temptations products, they vomit within minutes.<br />They LOVE it, they WANT it, it's CHEAP but it makes them puke, so, I'd consider this a bad purchase."
2,My one year old loves this product. She eats one every day and never gives me a problem. And I trust the ingredients which reassures me that she's eating something thats good for her.
2,"My son happily eats all of the fruit/veggie varieties of Earth's Best, unlike the Organic Baby products, none of which he likes at all.<br /><br />Be careful to only get the fruit and veggie variety packs, not the dinner packs, as they have meat in them."
1,"I have long been a fan of mixing juice, such as orange joice, with a carbonated soda like 7Up - it provided the best of both worlds, fresh juice and carbonation. The down side over the last number of years is the high fructose corn syrup that has replaced sugar in the carbonated sodas.<br /><br />But, of late there have been alternatives. First there was Orangina, which mixed 12% orange juice with carbonated soda - still had the sugar, but far better than mainstream sodas. Then a number of drinks have become available that mix the carbonation with a high percentage of real fruit juices. Some of these have been underwhelming to say the least. The best so far is IZZE with its 70% fruit juice and 30% carbonated water - no added sugars.<br /><br />Now comes along The Switch. The Switch is 100% fruit juice with carbonation added. And, like IZZE, I really like this drink. It is different than IZZE drinks; The Switch blends their juices different to achieve a little more subtle flavor where IZZE has more tang and punch. I can't say one is better than the other only that they each deliver a different refreshing experience.<br /><br />I have tried The Switch in Orange Tangerine and Black Cherry. The Orange Tangerine is very good! I highly recommend it. The Black Cherry is good, better than some other cherry drinks of this sort I have had, but it could be a bit better; it doesn't quite deliver the same flavor experience of a really good Black Cherry soda."
2,"My 8-month old son is not the picky eater my first was. He had only refused one flavor of all the baby foods introduced to him in 3 months (and it was peas-can't blame him for that one) but he REFUSED to swallow the Rice & Lentil flavor in this variety pack. He actually spit it back out and then blew raspberries (cute, but messy). I tried several times over 2 weeks and got the same response each time. We will not be ordering this pack again even though he loved each of the other meals."
4,"It looks like actual, human-grade food when you open the can. You can feed this to your cat with confidence.  My hard-to-please, anorexic cat really loved this food; I wish we'd found it sooner."
0,I have been drinking three cups of this tea for the last month and a half.  I just had my annual checkup with my doctor and my blood pressure was 108/60!!!!  After years of it being it the 140's or 135's my blood pressure is now like a young person and I am in my sixties.  I had been monitoring my blood pressure at home and it was good but usually when I see the doctor it shoots up because I am nervous but not this time.  My doctor was thrilled.  I totally believe that this tea has lowered my blood pressure and I will continue drinking it.  I steep it for 10 minutes.  I have two cups after breakfast and one cup after dinner.  It tastes good and I don't put any sweetener in it.  I highly recommend it as it did work for me.
2,"My baby hasn't died yet.<br /><br />If your baby has food allergies and your doctor prescribes this stuff... and you love your baby, it's certainly worth every penny. As expected, my daughter is still alive and she's doing well."
1,"When I tried a can of Switch Orange Tangerine I was expecting to taste something similar to Orange Crush or Sunkist soda.  Switch is actually quite different.<br /><br />Switch claims that it doesn't add any extra sugar or common additives found in most mainstream sodas.  And when you taste it, I believe them.  Since it doesn't have the added refined sugar of an Orange Crush-type soda, Switch comes across with a subtly harsher, more acidic taste. This can of Switch tastes like...well...carbonated orange juice.  To me, this is a good thing.  I enjoyed the flavor and found it tasty and pleasantly unique.<br /><br />Given all that, I would absolutely buy this product all of the time if it wasn't for the unfortunate price.  These cans are only 8.3 ounces and cost close to $1 per can.  That's a heck of a lot more than the $0.25-$0.33 you pay for a 12 ounce can of mainstream soda (when purchased as a typical 12 or 24 pack).<br /><br />I love the taste of this stuff, I love that it doesn't have all kinds of extra refined sugar, and I hate the price.  I want to buy it, but I just can't afford it and have to drop it to 3-stars on that merit alone.  Too bad."
1,"I saw an ad for Runa guayusa in Mother Jones magazine and because it is a Fair Trade item and described as less bitter than tea, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />It is exactly as advertised - no bitterness, just a little hint of sweetness, and a nice gentle flavor.  Very easy drinking, and it does give a kick of caffeine energy.  I have been a Diet Pepsi / Diet Coke drinker for 25 years because I like their tastes and the caffeine (never could do coffee and tea is too bitter), but I have recently converted to being a bicycle commuter for work and needed to ditch the heavy soda drinks.  This guayusa is perfect - as tea bags, it is obviously lighter than hauling around sodas, and it has more caffeine too.  Better for me, too.  And no bitterness like tea or coffee.  And I'm supporting fair trade small farmers in Ecuador instead of giant soda companies.  The packaging is 100% recycled, 70% post-consumer.<br /><br />This guayusa is as good as advertised, I like drinking it, and I can't think of any negatives.  5 stars.  I'm glad I found this product, it is worth the price."
0,"I have bought this product twice on Amazon, it is a bargain for six tins of tea.  Lady Grey tea has a unique flavor, different from the regular Earl Grey tea that is more common.  I find it more robust, very tasty and wonderful with a little milk."
2,These little guys are tasty and refreshing.<br /><br />I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.<br /><br />They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.<br /><br />This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves.  Cheers!
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry is very sweet, but tastes much better than the Orange Tangerine or the Black Cherry. It has a nice refreshing flavor though it's still not something I would buy.<br /><br />Ranking the Switch drinks from best to worst:<br /><br />1. Watermelon Strawberry<br />2. Kiwi Berry<br />3. Black Cherry<br />4. Orange Tangerine"
2,"My son wouldn't eat it either! I tasted it... I would not eat it, also. Tasteless, unappetizing in texture and  flavor.<br />It says ""minimal processing""... does that mean it is not even cooked? No wonder our babies and toddlers hate it!!! I would NEVER knowingly feed my child or myself RAW meat."
1,Short on flavor and not as advertised. Says no sugar but doesn't admit to the sugar found in the concentrated juices. My teens felt it was just ok with the flavor. I did not like it at all. Is it better than drinking pop? Probably but does the high price warrant the small differences?
0,"I couldn't really taste the bergamot in this tea.  It had more of a slight orange peel taste.  Since it is organic, I expected a cleaner, richer taste. It's OK, but not as good as the regular Twinings Earl Grey.  I have had other brands of organic that were superior to either of the Twinings, but at a much higher price."
4,My cats have eaten this for the last year without incident.  Their most recent visit to the vet reaffirmed that my 2-year olds are doing fine on this.
0,strong flavored tea the way I like it. I already went through one box in a couple months since I don't use the machine as much as I would like to.
2,my 26 month year old spotted these on his own while shopping at the supermarket and I had to overlook the $8.59 for 3 oz bag and just be glad that was what he was asking for.  the amazon price is somewhat better but higher then Just Tomatoes actual website.  I only question why at this price is all the fruit not sourced from the USA?  I find that a bit hard to believe but I guess everyone has to make a living. some of the fruit is from Vietnam.  The crunch of the fruit satisfies when in the need for a snack.  the fact that he is getting used to a non sugar snack as a special treat hopefully will establish his appreciation for fruits in their natural state.  the 3oz bag does have a lot in it more then I would have thought before buying.
1,"I like carbonated fruit juices and I think this one is fine.  It has a more tangy formula than the name suggests; it's more of a light fruit punch.  It's refreshing and a good serving size, in my opinion.  It's wonderful to have something that doesn't contain high fructose corn syrup!  What's here instead is: 100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates), gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c), contains soy.  Delicious.  Sweet.  Light.  Fruity.  Tangy.  Yum."
3,"I was surprised to find grandmas chocolate online lol, especially because this delicious product originated from Mexico. My mother used to give it to my brothers and me often enough, its part of our family you can say.  I have not found a chocolate that has a similar flavor whatsoever,this is the best chocolate, i highly recommend it, you'll  be surprised at the great lavor it has....salud!"
3,I love the product I use it over my Frozen Yocurt for a lower cal. desert.  Also have made chocolate candie with no cal. with some and cocoa  Very Yummy
3,"This cocoa is very good. I love it, so does my son. I actually like to mix half coffee with this cocoa, very tasty. And my son likes the flavor ,and the fact that it is low in carbs."
1,"My teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon!  They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy.  I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found  Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling grafefruit soda.  The grapefruit flavor goes well with spicy mexican foods, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop!  I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze."
1,"My guess is the other flavors of Switch taste better. I thought this had an overkill berry flavor and aftertaste. It probably would have been okay if it were cherry flavored. That being said, I'm not sure I would let my dislike of the flavor dissuade you from trying it. Could just be a personal preference."
0,"Just the right amount of blueberry flavor, and the tea itself is not overwhelming. I love that it has no added sweeteners, and really does not need them.<br />This is a perfect way to get more water and benefit from the antioxidants in the tea as well!"
2,not real crazy but this product. They did not taste good but looked real cute in the little booties I made for the baby shower tables.
0,This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.
1,"I like the concept of these natural, carbonated juice beverages and I really liked the black cherry flavor.  But the Kiwi Berry flavor was too sweet for me.  While the ingredients are only juice and carbonated water, I think that not enough water was added to reconstitute the juice to a good balance.  With 33 grams of sugar in the 8.3 ounce bottle, despite being natural, there is still a lot of sweetness here."
2,"Well I bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely. Pink Salmon is very good for you.<br /><br />This time I ordered again, received ALBACORE TUNA INSTEAD OF PINK SALMON. AMAZON DOES NOT DO RETURNS ON GROCERIES SUCH AS THESE, EVEN IF NOT OPENED THAT I CAN SEE. I sent personally an email to Raincoast Trading Company based in Canada, also left a phone message as well. Delayed response, but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item. Gone through hoops in the help center of Amazon to no avail. Until I found the Toll Free Amazon phone number, Amazon LLC confirmed they can not accept the return, but will send the correct item promptly. We shall see, awaiting a replacement item.<br />A minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon I am used to ordering.<br />Anyone want some tuna? O well.<br /><br />P.S. Updated  review Sept 30th 2009, I finally got the ordered item, partly because the Amazon rep corrected it when I called in and sent it fast! BTW, it cost me a Toll Call to Canada to the company without a prompt reply. That just added insult to injury. Well I was able to order from a different merchant through Amazon. Thank you Amazon for coming through :)"
1,there is not much one can say about Hawaiian punch.  my kids love it.  the only r eason i took off 2 stars is that i ordered 8 64 oz bottles and received 4 128 oz bottles.  i need the smaller bottles so my kids can pour on their own.  i will have to revert to going to the supermarket for future Hawaiian  punch needs.
4,"This flavor of Fancy Feast is decidedly the favorite of our waif of a cat.  She is usually a very picky eater, but this trout flavor really gets her excited.<br /><br />The local store ran out of this flavor and may not restock it, so I ordered online.  We got a good price and the case of food arrived in good condition.<br /><br />I was a little confused by the old label image that was on the web site that is just different enough from the new label that I had to double check that I was getting the item that I was expecting.<br /><br />It turned out to be the correct item, so all was well."
3,"I am on my second can, I ordered the case of 6 and I keep it hidden from the grandkids.  I never thought you could have good tasting dark hot chocolate.  I just heat a cup of water in the microwave for 80 seconds and add the chocolate.  It dissolves completely with stirring."
0,"This tea won an award in the USA and I know why....""Mandarin Silk Loose Leaf Oolong Tea""  is like the name suggests ""Silk"" silk on your tongue.  A tea that has a warm, relaxing taste that makes you feel wonderful...Well done ""Art of Tea""!"
3,"I looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa, but was very disappointed with the flavor. It has an awful aftertaste, like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. Also kind of weak, even on the smallest cup setting."
0,1 tea bag good for 32 oz pitcher. Great fruity clean taste. I love all of the Mighty Leaf Teas. The silk tea bags are so much nicer then the regular tea bags. Pricey but worth it.
1,"I really like the Switch drinks so far, 100 percent juice with a carbonation too, it is a nice combo for us soda loving consumers.  I think too that the carbonation prevents me from sucking down a can this size in one gulp. I like it so much I ordered, and I am halfway through a case of the black cherry flavor.  With free shipping in a combo order, the price of these drinks is pretty good.<br /><br />Kiwi Strawberry, it sounded like a weird combination mixing fruits I don't normally expect in a cocktail together.  Still it works, strawberry and kiwi seem to be very complimentary fruits, and I may eventually have to try a case of these, (the one can sample from the vine program is just not enough when the item is sold in cases)."
2,"We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors. I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein."
1,"I drink too much soda. I've started looking for alternatives and one of the things I've tried is switch. I first tried it because while it's like an orange soda, it's really carbonated juice.<br /><br />I like:<br />-The carbonation<br />-The flavor<br />-all juice<br />-no added sugar, no high fructose corn syrup<br />-no artificial flavors or colors<br /><br />I don't like:<br />-The small can (8oz)<br />-The flavor took a can to get used to it. It's a mixture of orange, apple, tangarene, grape, and Acerola juice. (Acerola is a fruit high in vitamin C, so I assume that's why it's used.) If you don't expect exactly orange soda, the flavor grows on you quickly.<br /><br />If I really want a cola, Switch isn't good enough to be my replacement. But it's a very easy replacement for an orange soda. I can't wait to try some of the other flavors. I usually really like black cherry drinks and I'm interested in seeing what fruit juices they use in that one!"
0,This is a pleasant enough White Tea but I don't taste Pear at all!  Which of course is disappointing considering I bought a flavored White Tea and not a plain one.  Won't buy again.  Prefer the CS Perfectly Pear instead.
0,"I debated a little about whether or not to order just because the reviews are so split down the middle. But I'm a big fan of other Two Leaves and a Bud varieties so I decided I had to give it a fair try. I'm glad I did! I prepared it with warm water, just the same as I do with all green tea, and it turned out really nicely. It's got a light smooth flavor & just a hint of orange. With just a little bit of stevia, it was perfect. I am not a sencha aficionado, so I cannot make a thorough comparison to other sencha teas. But I have been drinking a variety of green teas for a long time and can definitely say it stacks up to the other nice greens that I've had. It's also really refreshing iced so I recommend giving it a try that way this summer as well!"
1,"I also got the Cherry one and this is just as good.  It's a break from soda or water or coffee.  I really liked the light refreshing taste and it doesn't fill you up like sodas can.  It's very very tasty and it had a very fresh orange taste, not artificial tasting.  I really liked it."
4,"This is the best cat food- I introduced it to my 16yr old cat slowly and she is much healthier, has a shiner coat and sheds less. Each time I purchase, I switch up the flavors, cats love variety.<br />Great product!"
1,"Sorry, but I just don't ""get it"".  You pay almost a buck for 8.3oz (just over a cup) of carbonated water and fruit juice concentrate.  FYI, the first one listed on the can is Apple. . . then Grape. . . then Tangerine. . . then Orange.  The taste is fine, but personally, I would much rather have a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice. .  .for a lot less $$. The can is small and cylindrical, like an energy drink, but there's nothing in this to give you a ""boost"".  FYI, there are 140 calories in one can.  If you have the $$ to spend, then yes, it's a tasty beverage.  But it's simply not a good value in my book."
0,"This is a wonderful, full-bodied tea. Until I found it on Amazon I purchased it at a local store for $11 per tin.<br /><br />I'm not a tea expert, or an Earl Grey expert. I just know what I like, and whether it's coffee or tea, I like it strong and full-bodied. This tea fits the bill."
2,"My children will only eat healthy products, and they love these graham crackers.  I am so glad that they are available through Amazon!"
0,I wanted to try this type of powered Honey for my tea it is very good and a great alternative to Sugar works very well in Tea.
0,"The smell of this tea is wonderful. It smells like fresh mango juice. I would describe it as a very clean and refreshing smell, which is how I feel about most matchas. I will also say that I had no issues with clumps. I have been very careful to check the temperature of my water before adding it to the tea, and so far have not had any bitter disasters. The mango matcha has a grassy sweetness that definitely keeps the mango taste. The actual flavour isn't as strong as the smell, but I think that it would be overpowering if it was. I love this both hot and iced, which a slight edge going to the iced version. I haven't tried it yet in a smoothie, but I am thinking it would be fantastic. I did try adding a bit to some yogurt, and it was almost perfect - this was the only time I had clumps, but I also wasn't very patient trying to mix it all together. I would definitely purchase this again, and can't wait to try more from Red Leaf Teas."
2,"My picky eater loves this! She will eat only Gerber Organic Mac n Cheese and Gerber Organic Green Beans w/o any fussing. Yes, it is a bit runny, which makes it perfect for 4-6 month olds but it gives you the flexibility to thicken it with whatever you want for the older babies (e.g. rice cereal, meats, spinach, etc).<br /><br />Mommy loves it, too! Great taste!"
2,"Finally a baby food that tastes fresh!  Love that it's a great protein plus good veggies.  Great for anyone looking for a way to feed your baby ""good stuff."""
0,"One, one, wonderful ... from the Beach Boys ""Smile"" album.<br />This tea is that ... wonderful aroma and taste.<br />Try it and Smile !!!<br /><br />And .. It always ships on time !!!"
1,"This stuff is good, and I mean REALLY good. My husband drinks diet soda which contains aspartame, a known neurological toxin, and I wanted to provide a much safer alternative. I found this at PCC and he loved it. I can't STAND the taste of artificially sweetened things and I usually end up with a nasty migraine, and this didn't bother me one bit. The taste is fantastic in my opinion, but this seems to be a flavor you will either love or hate, which is why I would recommend picking up a 6 pack at the market before ordering a pack of 24."
1,"Tricky Marketing<br />(Look up ""True (sic) Blue"" dig deep into their site or study the vague label.)<br /><br />""100% Cranberry Juice"" is false labeling; ""100% Juice Cranberry"" passes...; has other juices for sweetening (apple, grape, pear) and for attractiveness: anything goes.<br />Just no sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Hence 100% juice.<br />With sugar is called ""natural sweetening."" ""Blend"" might not be 100% juices. Juice ""Cocktail"" is invariably with high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I found real Ocean Spray 100% Cranberry Juice in quarts at a ""Grocery Outlet"" market once a few years ago. Undrinkably tart, but perfect for making my own less-than-sweet blends and thirst-aides using fresh berries and fruits with water, and for extending store-shelf juices too sweet for me. 100% C.J. is not a consumer product, but for food & beverage product makers.<br /><br />Cranberry Juice Concentrate is also very handy & 100% CJ."
0,"Since being diagnosed with high blood pressure, this product has been a staple in our home. I especially enjoy the grilling blends. For the price I got it for online it was a great deak, usually much more expensive in store, so buying in bulk from Amazon is the way to go."
0,"I've tasted many varieties of Earl Grey tea, and I would have to say this one is the best. When they mention that this product has a ""bergamot citrus"" aroma, they surely don't mess around. It indeed packs a nice, powerful punch. Upon opening it, I almost had to catch my breath. My grandmother could even smell it across the room. Very delightful and very strong in its flavor and fragrance. This tea is powerful enough in strength to where it eliminates the need to use a lot of leaves. I feel that it will last me for quite some time. When you add the fact that it's kosher, fair trade, and USDA certified organic, I feel all the more better about it."
0,"this is the best iced green tea I've ever had; the hint of blueberry is just perfect.  I add a bit of Stevia for a little more sweetness.  It would be an insult to call this ""instant tea,"" but I carry a packet in my purse because it's better than any prepared tea I could buy when eating out.  Stash tea is always good, but this is extraordinary."
3,I've heard over and over that people are having a difficult time finding a hot chocolate pod to enjoy in their Keurig K-cup brewers.  The search is over!  This Grove Square Hot Cocoa received four big smiles from my sons. They just went on and on about how delicious it was!  I love having this new coffee pot where it's fast and convenient for all of us!  Super happy with this purchase.
3,"Was skeptical about the quality of hot chocolate from a K cup but Grove Square is amazing.  It is just as good as making it from scratch but without the fuss.  The milk chocolate is mild, the dark has enough bite to make it interesting and the peppermint is perfect for after dinner."
2,these are great. my baby loves them. it is one of his favorite foods and he's a picky little guy. they actually taste good and buying in bulk makes them way cheaper!
3,Be careful if you have a chocolate allergy.  The last box I purchased has cocoa powder as the ingredient and the cones are brown.  I know previous boxes did not contain cocoa powder and were a normal cone color.  The distributor should market these as chocolate cones and not try to pass them off as something else.  Note:  Be especially leary since this seller doesn't list ingredients.
3,"Kudos have been around for a long time, but the recent reformulation to make them 100 calorie bars was brilliant! Now, I am back to enjoying Kudos just about any time that I want them.<br /><br />This is the variety pack that has Snickers bars, M&M bars, and chocolate chip flavored bars - all of which are great! They're made of soft and sweet granola, with the flavor pieces mixed in, chocolate on the bottom, and chocolate drizzled on top. They're very tasty, and surprisingly satisfying for 100 calorie snacks. I am always on the lookout for good 100 calorie snacks, and these babies definitely fill the bill!"
0,"This tea and the Jasmine tea by Rishi are my go-to everyday teas. This Citron Oolong flavor is not overpowering and very complex in the same time. This is the combination I would have liked to come up with and it is not a tea that will ever become boring. It belongs in my subscribed list forever (hopefully never to be discontinued, or I will have to find the ingredients and brew it myself...)."
1,"It's very refreshing to find products without sugar added, but make no mistake, this tiny can still packs a solid 34 grams of sugar, enough to give you an energy rush followed by the typical adrenal fatigue crash.  Perhaps you can sip just a few ounces every few hours to avoid the crash?<br /><br />The flavor is very good and will tempt you to chug the whole can in one quick drink.  Not exactly a health drink, but it's a nice improvement over the usual junk sold as a soft drink."
0,"A very rich flavor, I am biased as I like Earl Grey Tea.  It's great for an after dinner tea, a little too heavy (for me) to be used in the early morning.  I found Rishi Tea to be flavorful and robust.  I wasn't previously a loose leaf tea drinker, but I'm now looking for the perfect set so I can start brewing the leaves at work.  It's also a perfect tea for the heavy coffee drinker who is looking for something different once-in-a-while.  Highly recommended."
0,"I have been drinking this green tea for sometime and was purchasing it when I was going to Syracuse every summer.  This year I stopped going there and didn't know where I was going to buy my tea until I spotted it on Amazon and purchased it.  I was so pleased  that I could get it, so I am now a happy camper once again."
0,"Simply heaven, Earl Grey notes, orange and lemon peel with lovely blue flower!!!<br /><br />La vraie decadence!!!<br /><br />Enjoy!!!"
1,"Way too heavy on carbonation. What flavors were there were too weak to detect. Sorry, but I won't be buying this one."
0,I ordered through source in the past and cancelled my membership due to the excessive charges every month. I was happy to look on amazon and find that I could purchase for much cheaper and use my prime account. This tea IS NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE THAT CAME IN THE BLACK BOX..The orignal tea is brown and this tea is green...the pamphlet is the same inside as the other and the fragile tea bags are the same but the tea is different. This one comes packaged much preetier but it does not taste the same. I have lost 20 pounds in the last 2 months by drinking this tea in the morning and only water throughout the day that is my only diet change. I used the other tea for a month and half and this new tea for 3 weeks now.. I dont want to stop taking the tea just is in case it is the contributor to my weight loss. The next order I will try the other tea that you have to pay for shipping on. I hope I can find this orginal stuff because this is not it.
1,"This is a great tasting product, to be sure, and I if I were a soft drink person in general, I would likely choose this over any of the leading sodas on the market. However, while there is ""no sugar added,"" it still tastes very much like candy. The black cherry version of ""The Switch"" is much less cloying in my opinion.<br />If you like sweet beverages, you'll love this, and the fact that it is all natural, is, of course, something to consider. This is a good choice for dessert, I suppose. There are apple, grape, kiwi, raspberry, strawberry and acerola juices in this drink, all of which combine for a nice flavor."
1,"I have long believed that you can get anyone to drink anything as long as you add enough sugar to it.  And this drink is proof of that.  It's 100% vitamin C but 34grams of sugar.  I actually think it would taste better if it were not carbonated.  It's just a juice pouch with carbonation.<br /><br />I really liked it, my kids really liked it and it was a very tasty drink.  But again, 34 grams of sugar, wow.  It's also only 8 ounces.  I tried the strawberry kiwi, it left a syrupy taste in my mouth.  I would not purchase again, just because of the sugar level.  If you disregard than it is a good drink nevertheless."
1,"This would be a great soup if Health Valley  lowered the sugar content at least in half or more. The company took the Health out of the Valley with this soup.When one buys a No Salt soup they are doing so for Health Reasons, if one is watching their salt  intake they are  also in most cases concerned about their sugar intake .I buy health Valley No Salt Soups because  they are Organic , No or little salt  and yes low in sugar, 14 grams of Sugar is shameful.They do a good job with their No Salt Soups except with their Tomato Soup. Fix it Health Valley . Use carrots as a sweetener?? Give it some thought???"
1,"This product is delishy.  I did a 10K recently and decided this would be my recovery drink of choice that day.  Forget the amazing nutrient content in the bottle, the flavor is fantastical.  I highly recommend to anyone looking to mix up their recovery routine."
2,"This is great baby food.  It has an interesting texture that our baby likes in her mouth, and she loves the taste.  I love that she gets protein that is more than puree, but not so thick she can choke."
2,"The Earth's best 'grourmet' line is heavy on the protein. And as far as I know adequate protein is important for babies and they need, like the rest of us, good iron levels.<br /><br />The beef and spinach contains 5 grams per serving. You can check your cans, but most of the other's we use the protein is 2 grams. Our daughter likes it. It is also the least expensive of the 'gourmet' line and this is not something I could find in local stores. Recommended."
1,"I drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular strawberry and kiwi flavored soda, which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from 100% juice!  It has 135 calories and a great alternative to a regular soda.  I will definitely be purchasing these in the future!  I also tried their Orange Tangerine carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well."
4,This is a product that I have used when I lived in NY state.  I loved the Pussy Cat Mix but use this now from a receipe that the company gave me.  I cannot buy the any Bartenders mix here in Arizona so I am delighted to be able to get it through Amazon.  The service is great.  I forgot to mention that company is not making Pussy Cat Mix any longer.  All good things come to an end.
0,"Rishi lives up to their name with their Earl Grey tea:  The leaves are full, dark, long, & curled up on themselves.  No crappy pieces of tea leaves that some companies like to call loose leaf tea!<br />The killer tin is packed to the top with these sweet smelling leaves!  I hardly needed any tea to brew a sweet tasting & pleasantly aromatic cup!  I have a tendency to overbrew my tea & I probably let this brew for about 15 to 20 min. & it wasn't the least bit bitter! Very enjoyable!  Great with honey, better with honey and cream!  YUM! I have a feeling this tin is going to last me a long while!<br />I have one slight problem, it says it contains ""natural essential bergamont oil"".  Why isn't it organic????<br />Fortunately the tea itself is 100% Organic Fair Trade certified. Fair Trade means workers get paid a fair wage for their work/product instead of getting mere pennies a day.<br />Love your body & go organic whenever you can.  If you don't buy organic tea, you are ingesting A LOT of pesticides & chemicals in concentrated forms - brewing the chemicals right into your cup!  Yuck!"
3,"You know how the chocolate turns light brown when it gets old? That's how these were at the top. They were that lighter shade of brown as if they were old. That part just didn't taste right, but the liquor inside was good. These candies weren't fresh."
1,"The Switch is a great alternative to the usual carbonated sodas.  It is all natural and 100% juice with all the vitamin C a body needs.  It tastes just about as sweet as soda but without the corn syrup/sugar.  It is less carbonated than soda but I like that.  It also has a ""lighter"", crisper taste.  The Kiwi Berry flavor is good but my favorite is the Black Cherry flavor.  I recommend both but keep in mind that the can is only 8.3 ounces and costs more than soda.  I think it is worth it!"
0,This is a great set for all real tea lovers!<br />I recommend adding a slice of lemon and sugar to Earl Grey to strengthen bergamot flavor!
0,"I have enjoyed a cup of tea, preferably green tea, for breakfast in the morning for over 50 years, and I'm here to say this is the very best of all. I never used to like bothering with loose tea but this is very manageable as it is rolled young tea leaves. It's actually fun to handle! You can make it as strong as you like it. For a green tea it is very robust, I'd call it the Irish breakfast of green tea. I'm totally spoiled for other green teas now and am very happy to be able to buy the multi packs. Thanks Amazon!"
4,"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether."
2,"I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'.<br /><br />I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!<br /><br />I believe a little heating brings out the flavor."
2,These pouches were very easy to take with us and the baby just LOVED it! No leftovers here. I really like that they come in two protein varieties - chicken and a turkey! Great options and easy to take with you!!
2,"I first found these at our local ""mart"" store (you know which one) but they are often out of stock totally or only have one flavor.<br />This flavor, the apple cinnamon is good, but not my favorite. It's basically just applesauce with cinnamon like you can buy in the big jars, but this has no preservatives, colorings, additives, water dairy or gluten-nothing artificial...just apples and cinnamon, but the texture is much smoother than regular applesauce. It's not as smooth as baby food, but somewhere in the middle. It's extremely convenient for on the go, for kids *no spill and it has a cap!*, trips etc. They're a little spendy..in fact, more so here than at the local store, which is strange, but worth it to have the type you want, when you want it. I actually think my husband and I like it more than my 2nd grader! My personal favorite is the apple/strawberry flavor. I'm not a banana fan, so i haven't tried that flavor.<br />This brand also makes pure fruit bites, which are basically fruit snacks, but without added sugar, preservatives or anything but 100% fruit..and best of all in my opinion, NO GELATIN! They're very yummy, more so than sugary fruit snacks...they're a little tart which is nice. It's so great to have good snack food options, they're a great, fun way to get your daily fruits in. And, like the fruit pouches, they come in a resealable, ziplock type pouch which is also super convenient.<br /><br />All Natural<br />No preservatives<br />No added sugar<br />Soooo YUMMY!<br />..who could ask for anything more??"
2,Our pediatrician recommended we feed our constipated 6 month old prunes. He wasn't too thrilled with the taste but it did the job:P
0,"Okay, I didn't read the description very well.  I ordered ""loose"" tea on accident.  By ""loose"" tea, I just thought it still meant it would be in a tea bag.  I know, don't make fun of me.  I just didn't read it well, and I am not an expert on tea.  Being frugal like I am, I was forced to use the tea anyway.  (I would still like directions on how to make it without a fancy strainer.  It just went straight through my colander.  hee hee) I put the recommended amount in the coffee maker and brewed it that way.  It was way too strong.  I was able to get three gallons of iced tea from the recommended amount for one.  Anyway, after a lot of trial and error, I now have drinkable tea.  Lipton has always been my favorite tea, and after I drink all of this that I purchased, I will probably stick with the loose tea.  Frugality wins always..."
3,This is a wonderful Dark Chocolate flavor.  Much deeper flavor than the Milk Chocolate.  The Milk Chocolate is good but does not have this deep flavor.  Will be buying this again.!!!
3,This is a great hot cocoa as long as you read the box and only use the 8oz setting on your coffee make. Otherwise it will taste watered down. Also it is an instant coffee so dont be surprised by it.
0,Maybe my tastebuds are different but I bought this at a local healthfood store and I'm not completely sold on it.  I tried it in my tea and it did leave me w/ an aftertaste...just like most sweetners. *shrugs*
0,"This Yogi tea flavor doesn't really have the strong flavor like Peach Detox or Women's Energy just to name a few. This tea has the Lavender smell. OMG! The fragrance can linger for a long time in my mouth and throat after drinking this tea. Just make me feel so good and calm. YES! Just soothing and relaxing. My 70 year old mother who is usually picky on her tea choices, I let her try this tea when she visits. After a cup, she told me - hum.. Get me more, this is good and I want to share with my circle of friends. This tea is ""Mother proves""!"
2,"Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Fruit Variety Pack<br />Normally I would say this is a great idea, but I wasn't a fan of this particular variety. My son would have been just fine with it, but unfortunately for us at this point my daughter is allergic to raspberries and mangos. These are both things I think she'll grown out of, but something you may want to consider when purchasing this item. I would suggest trying an individual serving of one from your local store to see if your child has an allergy, but if they don't I would say buy it! Other than that I do think it's a great variety for kids who need some changing up occasionally. Also, the subscription price on this variety is great and can be altered depending on how soon you need it. We ended up running through another subscription we had and were able to have another shipped as soon as we needed it."
1,"Diet Pepsi is the best soda available, anywhere!!!  When traveling outside the U.S. I always ask for it and if it's not available,I prefer to have plain carbonated water rather than the ""other"" cola.  My refrigerator always, and I mean always, has at least five or six bottles on the shelf and my pantry holds another 12 or so bottles.  I can only hope that it will always be manufactured."
2,"My 18 month old grandson only eats organic foods, and I was looking for a treat to give him when he visits. He loves these candies, and I don't feel too guilty because they are in a tiny packet with only a few in each one. They stay at Grandma's and Grandpa's house! (Of course we brush his teeth afterwards.)"
1,I love the tubes of hrissa!  There is much less waste and the flavor is just as wonderful as the same product in the cans.
1,"No harsh after taste, no tangible negatives.  It just doesn't have the ""bite"" that I crave from other carbonated beverages like ginger ale or root beer.  It's a good option for a healthful drink with some fizz."
4,"I have 16 cats ranging from 1 to 11 yrs old and every single one of them likes this.  I have tried Wellness, Holistic, Avoderm, Chicken Soup for the..., Merck Homestyle, BG (Before Grain), California Natural, and Evangers with mixed results.  This is the first canned food that all of them will not only eat but eat all of it.  I've fed them the Chicken and Liver flavor and the Seafood flavor so far and they seem to like both equally.  I find it a bit more expensive than I had hoped it would be, but then again there is no waste and I consider that in itself a savings alone.  I'm a firm believer in better ingredients and less fillers and allergens make for less poop, less litter use, fewer trips to the vet and an overall healthier cat.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I have tried all the flavors on my cats and the chicken and liver seems to be the one they like the most.  They have now officially rejected all the other flavors including the seafood flavor that they originally liked.  I also wanted to add that this is a very STRONG smelling brand of cat food, almost overpowering when I open the cans at feeding time."
2,"We love them! This is a great 100 calorie snack. I snack on them throughout the day. My husband, and 3 year old enjoys eating them as well."
1,"I tried the cherry and Strawberry Kiwi.  Both are similar in taste.  This beverage tastes okay, nothing special.  It is quite sweet and can I say ... a little salty (not sure where's that from!)  It's like mixing concentrate fruit juice with club soda or carbonated Libey's Juicy Juice?<br /><br />I would occasionally buy this product (because it doesn't taste bad at all) but I'll keep my fridge filled with Crush Orange soda for now..."
3,This product wad very weak! I couldn't even make out that it was supposed to be hot chocolate. Will never buy again a waste of money!
1,"I could definitely taste the berries, harder to find the kiwi though.<br />I like that there's no heavily processed sweeteners (no HFCS) but still the funny thing about all these fruit juices in a can is that they almost always contain apple and grape juices and then the rest. I wonder actually how much kiwi juice is in there.<br />It's sparkly and I tried it when it was not cold enough so it was a bit too sweet for me."
4,I adopted a 12 yo cat from a woman who had a premature baby with a lung condition.  She's skinny and will eat very little besides Wiskas.  I think it's Soilent Green for cats.  I would never feed this to her if she would eat anything else.  I don't think she's long for this world!!
0,"This has a great rich taste. Remember this is ground whole leaf, so the tea is stronger than you may expect.  Not overly sweet and dissolves readily.  I use it during workouts mixed with ice water in a Polar bottle."
0,This is my favorite kind of tea.  I use the loose tea in my Kurig.  It works great and the six small cans are easy to use and to store.
0,"This Earl Grey is of very high quality with an even texture and nice color when brewe. The bergamot is pronounced without being too strong, unless you're really sensitive to bergamot. I found the overall taste to be quite mild, even when it had been steeping a long while. This is definitely the best organic Earl Grey I've tasted."
3,"These are chocolatey with a touch of spice. Tasty but expensive, I imagine this is something you could make at home! But these are good overall."
1,This stuff taste just like flavored carbonated water.<br />In this case Flavored with orange and tangerine.<br />I imagine it's better for you than plain soda.<br />I really found it tasty. It has a strong citrus flavor<br />that I preferred to some of the other flavors.
4,"No more dry kibble for our felines!!!  After a few medical emergencies and educating myself WHY cats are not designed by Mother Nature to eat dry kibble (ANY brand), I changed our clan of felines to HEALTHY wet food.<br />Every cat with a blocked urinary tract is fine, until they start to strain to urinate and have to be rushed to the ER.<br />With all the issues of recalls and such concerning the pet food industry, we rotate 3 different brands of food. Felidae is one.  It has NO grains, soy, corn, or icky fillers. Felidae is a pate loaf-like consistency.<br />Since changing to a wet food only diet, none of our cats have been back to ER in years.  None throw up.  No runny eyes.  Coats are shiny. No matted hair.  All are at a perfect weight.  The changes are amazing.<br />Having 5 cats, I am VERY thankful for the 13 oz size cans of Felidae.<br />I had a question recently and sent Felidae an email.  They answered very promptly and were very kind.  Their customer service deserves 5 stars also."
1,"Fruit juice has lots of calories, so at home, we often dilute grape or orange juice with water or seltzer and ice. We like the flavor and the bubbles make for a more refreshing drink. The Switch is a portable alternative - a little carbonation, nice flavor, more like tangerine than orange, and 100% of the daily requirement for vitamin C. When convenience is important, The Switch is a good, healthier alternative to soda."
0,"With that said, it is a tasty combination of herbs that will open up your lungs a bit. It tastes minty/sweet which is soothing, but theres no tea. Check the ingredients."
2,"It smells delicious but unfortunately my 11 month old was having problems with the Amaranth.  He does eat some finger foods - mango, peaches, carrots, etc... but for some reason he was having problems with the Amaranth - maybe it was too grainy for him.  Will try it down the road again."
0,"As a long time Yerba Mate and Coffee drinker, Runa's Traditional Guayusa has switched me over permanently!  The super smooth and sweet flavor to this ""tea"" gives it the same drinkability of any other stimulant based drink, but with the lasting power and complexity as any high end tea.<br /><br />Drink up!"
1,"This drink contends to be a natural alternative to soda.  While it definitely is ""natural"", I would not agree with the ""alternative to soda"" aspect.  Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces).  Sure, it's lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn't make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, I'd go with Hansen's sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.<br /><br />The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesn't get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don't get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.<br /><br />Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldn't make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldn't give this to my kids.  Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them.<br /><br />Not recommended, sorry."
1,"***<br />The Switch claims to be an alternative to unhealthy sodas, and it is that--it is much healthy than most of the commercial versions out there. It does provide 100% of the day's vitamin C and does contain only fruit juice concentrates, no added sugars, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and no gluten.<br /><br />However...it is cloyingly sweet--a great taste of kiwi and strawberries--but way too sweet for me. The Switch also provides a huge sugar hit via the fructose in the highly concentrated juices and has 135 calories in only 8.3 fluid ounces. Of 34 grams of carbohydrates, 33 are from sugar.<br /><br />I don't carbo load, so it doesn't really appeal to me at all. I'd rather eat the real fruit and get the fiber and other ingredients, or else have a less sweet drink. I tried using it as a concentrate and mixing 1 part soda to 3 parts water, which made it drinkable for me; although this worked well, I'd still probably stick with other beverages.<br /><br />Recommended, only if you want to ease your way off of unhealthy sodas and like very sweet drinks.<br />***"
1,"I love izze sprarkling juice, it is amazing.  My favorite flavors would have to be apple and blueberry.  I was curious to try the grapefuit one though because someone told me it tastes like fresca, and I love fresca.  I tried it and in no way does it taste like fresca, its much milder then fresca and not a very strong grapefruit flavor at all.  I found it to lack in the grapefruit flavor but more of a peach flavor to be honest.  I have not tried the peach one yet but I am guessing it tastes like the grapefruit one:D lol  Oh well, I am just not a big fan of peach drinks.  If you are someone who likes a milder taste of grapefruit then you will love this, its very smooth.  I dont like very smooth so this is not my favorite, I like my drink to have a bite to it.  It is ok, but I will stick to blueberry and apple from now on. The really awesome thing about these drinks though is they are lower calorie then your normal juice, all natural and no added sugar, and each glass bottle has 2 servings of fruit, you cant beat that."
2,I started giving these to my daughter when she was 9 months.  She loved them so much her first word was cracker (while signing more)!  They dissolve in her mouth so I don't have to worry about choking.  And they are healthy too.  I highly recommend it.
1,"This 100% juice, carbonated beverage is a good alternative to traditional soda. As a somewhat health-conscious consumer, I avoid high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as much as possible. This beverage contains no HFCS, no added sugar, no preservatives, and no added color. I'm sampling the orange flavor. It contains 100% of your daily recommended dose of Vitamin C, and 20% of your Vitamin A for the day. The downside is a single 8.3 fl oz can contains almost as many calories as a 12 oz a can of soda.<br /><br />The Orange-Tangerine flavor reminds me a bit of Orangina. Perhaps you've tried Crystal Geyser's Fruit Squeeze beverages which are also similar. It's definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages (Sunkist, Crush). It has a hint of grapefruit-like taste to it, but without the bitterness, which may be due to the added apple, grape, and acerola concentrates. The aftertaste is a bit metallic to me. The beverage itself is clear - without pulp of any kind - and is light-orange-yellow in color.<br /><br />This is a good alternative to those looking for something soda-like, but healthier than all the HFCS-loaded options. Maybe it's a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway. Personally, I don't enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available, similar products. If I want orange juice or crave soda, I'll rather drink the real thing."
4,My cats all love this product just like they love the other flavors. I dare not run out of these treats or I might have a kitty uprising!
0,"I use this for iced tea and it is just so much better than American teas - it just plain is!  It is all I buy, and now I get it for others too.  Look no further."
2,"The title of my review says it all (as long as it didn't get cut off). These have a lot more air in them than the Gerber Little Crunchies. These crush extremely easily and get dust/crumbs all over the place. Also, they do not taste nearly as good as the Gerber Little Crunchies. They might be better for you, and I like that it has a hint of veggies in it, but my 17 month old isn't very happy with them. She'll snack on them if that's her only option and she's really hungry, but she definitely will not choose them. We first got these several months ago and she's had the same reaction to them every time since then."
0,My friends and I have enjoyed this kind of tea at a resturant called P.F.Changs and I found it at a local store but much better prices at Amazon. I am enjoying it for icetea as well as hot tea. Very good tea. I split the order with a friend who also liked it and wanted some.
1,"Here's yet another carbonated juice drink, comparable with OOBA Hibiscus With Orange, 16 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 12) & <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  This one, however, is an unusual combination of orange & tangerine.  I didn't really like the flavor much though I like both orange & tangerine separately.  But, the taste is in the bud (s).  I prefer the Izze of the 3.  As for the juice, it's more apple/grape than orange/tangerine & the Vit. C is the silly recommended dose--to prevent scurvy--not much really (per Linus Pauling).  True, it doesn't have corn syrup/sugar/or substitutes--which is nice.  But, at close to $1/8.3 oz it's equivalent to about $1.50 for 12 oz (in a pack of 24 small cans).  Seems pricey to me--why not just buy orange juice?"
2,"My son loves these, thank goodness.  They hold up well in soymilk for ceral in the morning and also hold up well in snack bags.  He is constantly needing 'O' shaped cereal for projects at school, and these work great.  They are a bit sweet, but he doesnt mind."
0,"Great taste. There is a slight bitterness to this tea, but it's black tea - it's bound to be a little bitter, especially for being so strong. The strength is perfect for customizing to taste. Some people like strong tea while others like theirs very mild, so you can add more water if you want. I like to make a fairly strong tea (the melting ice dilutes it just fine) and sweeten it myself. I like sweet tea, but usually when I get it, it just tastes like sugar water. These give me the strong tea flavor I love, and I can add the perfect amount of sweetness. Great product!"
0,"I can't get enough of this tea.  It fills my go-mug every morning on the way to work, and warms me in those early winter meetings.<br /><br />This is a great alternative for people who can't drink camellia-based tea (green, black, white, conventional or decaf) or want a caffeine-free alternative.  It lacks the sharp bite of oxidized rooibos, but still has its fruity tones.  It's not so exotic that you'd get sick of it quickly; it's not so unremarkable that you don't care if you finish your mug.  It's just right."
2,"One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week."
3,"My 12 year old loves to make a cup of this before school every morning. The cocoa tastes wonderful and brews up nice. We add a splash of milk to cool it off and it's so good. I don't taste anything artificial, in fact the quality is great. We will bring this camping for the younger kids. With the powders we always had clumps, this brews a great cup every time and tastes like the expensive coffee shop stuff!"
0,"****<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings' Sugar Plum Spice is a delightful holiday tea. It contains hibiscus, roasted barley malt, roasted chicory root, rosehips, chamomile flowers, natural plum flavor with other natural flavors, ginger root, roasted carob, and cardamom. It does not contain caffeine, so it's technically an herbal tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use ""natural flavors"" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called ""effervescent decaffeination"" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.<br /><br />On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, ""Take a sip of Sugar Plum Spice and journey with us to the Land of the Sweets in Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. Here you'll find gingerbread houses, trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine. This is the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy, who is beautiful, gentle and kind. We created this tea to pay tribute to her. Sugar Plum Spice is made with 100% natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice, with just a hint of sweetness."" This tea is slightly sweet and full bodied, tasting just as you would expect from the description. The cardamom and ginger give it a little zing. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.<br /><br />I recommend it, even if it's not a holiday. It's perfect for a cold or wet winter day.<br /><br />****"
0,Not as strong of a taste or smell like other teas.  Still good for a nice hot cup of tea
2,My daughter loves this food. This is her favorite of all the HappyBaby Organic Baby Food. I make all of her fruits and vegetables but decided not to continue this with the meats. She did great transitioning from the food I make at home to this packaged product so it must taste pretty fresh.
1,"I don't often drink soda for a couple reasons...  it's all high fructose corn syrup and various artificial flavors (and the diet stuff has even worse stuff.)  With that said:  this stuff is good.<br /><br />It doesn't leave that weird aftertaste in your mouth, or that sticky slime in the back of the throat (or is that just me?), or BURN going down.  It tastes ""fresh,"" for lack of a better term.  Containing 100% fruit juice is a huge step forward for a soft drink - not really because it's going to supply you with a serving of fruit or anything, but because it's actually FOOD.  (Corn syrup + some contrived chemical flavoring of other soft drinks, in my book, is not food.)<br /><br />All in all, this is good, has a great flavor, and just has a ""cleaner"" flavor that the sugary/corn-syrupy stuff.  (I didn't really notice it being too sweet.  To comment on other reviews saying it's mostly other fruit juices...it's because apple and grape juice are incredibly sweet.  Other fruits are usually used as flavoring, not as sweeteners.  A strawberry (or kiwi) may taste sweet when eaten whole, but the juice by itself really isn't sweet enough to be passed off as ""juice,"" except by fanatics.)<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend to anyone who wants a good tasting natural soda.  I liked it enough to want to try out the other flavors..."
0,"Not bad.  This tea does not taste like an oolong tea.  I'm sure if they say it's oolong, then it probably is an oolong, but it really tastes more like a green tea.  It's also very mildly flavored.  I find it benefits from a longer brew time than recommended.  There's certainly no bitterness upon over brewing this tea as there would be with a black tea, and the slight floral flavor and fragrance seems to be enhanced rather than harmed by this.  The flower bloom is durable: I put an unfinished pot in the refrigerator overnight to try it as iced tea, and the flower survived perfectly well without disintegrating.  If anything, the tea benefited from the additional overnight brew.  Served cold, the flavor comes out even more if you're partial to iced tea.<br /><br />The flower arrangement upon brewing is pretty--nowhere near as pretty or as perfect as the pictures that Numi shows on their website, and it's as likely to bloom lopsided as it is to flower right side up.  Some of them even bloom upside down.  Don't expect perfection and you'll be pleased with it."
3,"This Hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa I've ever had. I know it's not going to taste like the real thing, but after just three cups I can't bring myself to finishing the box. I think I'll just throw them out. Our k-cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we've tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa. The first try was very watery so I thought the cup size needs to be reduced. This results in just a sweeter cup of hot water. Stick with coffee."
2,I love Earth's Best products. That's the only product I use for my baby! My baby loves it and I never had any problem with it. It organic which makes it all that much better!
3,"A couple years ago, my husband pointed this cocoa out to me.  He hadn't tried it, but he'd always been amused by the granny's mischievous smile.  Since he'd been trading smirks with Abuelita for so long, I insisted we try it, and we haven't looked back.  Made with milk, the cocoa has a full flavor complemented by a nice, spicy accent.  Everything else now tastes bland by comparison."
0,"The written description of this tea was good enough to get me to put it on my wish list this xmas. My wife prefers the sweeter fruitier teas, such as Republic of Tea's Kiwi Pear, and I generally go for traditional blacks, Prince of Wales, Oolongs, etc. But this tea is perfect for both of us! I always liked good vanilla teas, and some coconut teas always blew me away as well. Our pals at Steep Tea still make some of the best teas in around, so we were pretty game to try this Lana's tea - it always feels good to try out teas by the 'small guys'.<br /><br />Anyway, there was this unbelievably great aroma to this tea that we couldn't pin down until one of our pals pointed out ""This smells like Bailey's!"" Bingo. Need I go on?"
1,I didn't like this carbonated juice.  Although it appears to be all juice (not artificial flavors) it tastes somewhat artificial.  Perhaps it tastes more like canned orange juice (which tastes NOTHING like REAL orange juice)!  I fully expected to like this as I do like fizzy fruit juice drinks.  This one did not do it for me.
4,"One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also."
2,These pouches are so easy and convenient. They taste great and are perfect for busy moms.
4,My cat suffers from bladder cysts frequently since i have used this now since november 2011 he has not had 1 attack of not being able to pass his urine. i place a few drops in his food every week. btw he does not like it but tolrates it. at first i had to use eye dropper and place a few drops in his mouth but after time he got used to it. a giant thank you this has saved me so much worry whether or not he will be ok.
1,"This is a pleasant tasting drink.<br />Sweet, fruity and carbonated. I like the fact that it's one hundred percent juice.<br />Again however, with the Switch drinks, the flavor wasn't really distinguishable.<br />It tastes great though and I really enjoyed it."
3,"Having tried all the varieties of hot chocolate k-cups, Grove Square's are by far the best.  They are very chocolaty, rich, creamy, and leave very little sludge in the bottom of your cup.  Yum..."
3,AS  A CHOCOHOLIC FOR  MANY YEARS I CRAVE A GOOD CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE.  THIS DONE IN THE KEURIG IS REALLY EASY AND FAST.  THE MILLK CHOCOLATE<br />IS TASTY AND THE DARK CHOCOLATE TASTES LIKE THE MANY CUPS OF COCOA I HAD AS A CHILD.  NOT PARTICULARLY CARRIED AWAY BY THE  PEPPERMINT<br />FLAVOR BUT IT WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH  TO MATTER.
0,A co-worker gave me a couple of the Harney & Sons Fine Teas Hot Cinnamon Spice Sachets to sample. The cinnamon spice flavor is wonderful. These teas are not available at my local grocery stores. I was glad to find them for a reasonable price on-line.
0,"I drink this tea every day (I'm 7 months pregnant), and have done so since I found out I was pregnant.  I love that it's organic and contains all the herbs that support a healthy pregnancy.  I don't notice anything dramatic when I drink it or don't drink it, but I will say I feel nourished when I drink it, and have had NO PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS WHATSOEVER.  I'm 36, this is my first pregnancy, and I have been exceptionally healthy throughout.  I highly recommend this for any pregnant woman--at least a cup a day!"
1,"The SANS Black Cherry Soda is the best tasting ""diet"" soda I have tried. The sweetener is the herb Stevia which is natural. With ""0"" calories and ""0"" sugar, it is a great refreshing drink."
2,"I have been making my son's baby food but needed a break since he's starting to eat more.  I only buy organic food for him and Chick Chick is one of his favorites.  I tasted it and it's a little bland for me but I'm also not a baby.  He loves it and as long as he does, I'll keep it stocked for him.  I love the Happy Baby/Happy Tot brand and the variety they offer.  I prefer jars for convenience but I just empty this into a jar to heat.  I did find that one of the pouches had a leak at a seam.  I'm glad that I saw it before I gave it to him.  Now I check them each thoroughly before I open them.  If I can squeeze food out of a seam, it gets pitched."
0,I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me.
1,"Switch does not taste like carbonated juice.  It tastes like overly sweet orange soda, which may or may not be a positive for you.  The 8.3 ounce can contains 34 grams of sugar.  I did not like the taste, my husband thought it was okay.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 is because it does not have any preservatives, added sugars, or high fructose corn syrup.  It does however contain soy, so if you are allergic or concerned about GMO soy, then you may want to avoid this drink.<br /><br />If you are looking for a natural, sweet, carbonated beverage, I would recommend OOBA Hibiscus drink over this."
3,I ORDERED THE DARK HOT COCOA IN HOPES IT WOULD BE REAL CHOCOLATEY AND IT WAS NO BETTER THAN BUYING A POUCH OF HOT CHOCOLATE AND ADDING IT TO HOT WATER. I ACTUALLY THINK THE POUCH ADDED TO HOT WATER IS LOADS BETTER AND A WHOLE LOT CHEAPER!!!! V-E-R-Y ...D-I-A-P-P-O-I-N-T-E-D! FOR THE PRICE...IT'S A RIP-OFF!
0,"I purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present, she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time, I didn't realize it was so hard to find!  She absolutely loves it, made a great surprise christmas gift."
0,This Lady Grey loose tea is a sensory experience. It is light and citrusy with just the right kick of caffeine. The flower petals are pretty but I cannot taste any difference they might make in the steeped tea. It would make a nice gift for a woman who you don't know very well. All in all it is worth a try.
1,"The can is pretty, a vibrant carnation pink. But although the can purports to contain 100% juice, a quick inspection reveals that apple and grape, not kiwi and berry (strawberry, raspberry) get top billing on the ingredients list.  Unsurprisingly, the flavor seems a little muddled, a little tangy, awfully sweet.  One family member described it as bubble gummy, another noted that it tasted metallic but ""maybe in a glass bottle it would taste okay.""<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, this product is heavy on fruit sugars, though I appreciate the absence of that cloying corn syrup sweetener that contaminates so many popular soft drinks.  There is nothing particularly nutritious about Switch, but maybe some parents (presumably the target market) won't be able to figure that out.<br /><br />It's not the worst carbonated beverage I've ever tried, but it's nowhere near the best, nor does it have the fresh wholesome flavor that we spoiled consumers expect from our fruit juices.  I'll stick with water."
0,"When tea is decaffeinated, is all the flavor removed? Or is this just lousy tea? In any case, all you get from a couple of these tea bags in a (12 oz.) mug of hot water is--hot water! True, the hot water is slightly brownish after five minutes of steeping, but there's no tea flavor at all. Very disappointing."
2,The ingredients are just great that's why I ordered it but when I opened the pouch and tasted... I know it's very healthy but this meal is not eatable.  I have ended up adding few spoons to meals I cook or just other baby food but this is it.
2,"Both our twins love this one right from the start but it's not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they're 10 months.  I'm glad they are eating something green because we couldn't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months, but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 months.<br /><br />Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon. They love all the fruit varieties.<br /><br />I'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein, although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredients.<br /><br />This one also has carrots and I've heard all babies like carrots.  I don't know if they would like it without the carrots.  I haven't seen this one - lentils and brown rice - in our local stores, so I'm glad to get it here. Along with some others, we get this one with the subscription.  Of course, with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we're so busy that it's great to get these delivered.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent.  I've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 10% protein, 100% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult."
0,"This is a great tea especially for Earl Grey lovers. The price is fantastic, I think you can't buy it in England for this price. Thanks"
0,I have a hard time finding Earl Grey tea cups in the stores...they sell English Breakfast...but I really prefer Earl Grey...this was the best price I found...
1,"To be blunt, I was throughly underwhelmed with this product and I am finding it hard to come up the words to describe why, but the problem is that orange SWITCH doesn't have a lot going for it, so there isn't a lot one can say about it.<br /><br />To me, this product is canned orange juice and club soda, packaged in a trendy little can.<br /><br />And like all canned orange juice (Blue Bird brand, et. al.) there is an off taste to it that reminds you it isn't fresh squeezed juice.  Add to that this fizzy aspect, and its just kinda, well, there.<br /><br />I can't say that this is a healthy drink - orange juice has some of the highest concentrations of sugars for a fruit drink.  And its cost per can is steep, especially when compared to making this stuff at home with club soda and fresh squeezed juice.<br /><br />I can't give it one star - I would reserve that for something undrinkable as Amazon requires a minimum one star to do a review.  So my two star rating should be taken to mean that you can drink it and its unoffensive, but thats about all you can say about it."
0,"It is hard to get Assam tea in the store, let alone organic Assam.<br />I was pleased at how fast this one arrived and how nicely it is<br />packaged."
0,"I was not expecting much from this tea. After all there are literally dozens of products out there each day claiming to be magical cure-all. So, does this detox tea work? I have no medical training other than first aid, but I will say that I do feel refreshed after drinking it. I have tried it hot, warm, cold, sweetened (with honey) and unsweetened. The tea has a very light chai flavor to it, which I enjoy. But I have to say that around $20 for 120 bags (about .60 per bag) that if you are not a fan of tea then I would have to say that this is not for you when you can go to the grocery store and buy plain old tea (that also has 'detox' properties to it) for around $5 for the same quantity. But for something different from the usual, which what I was looking for, I have to say I am pleased."
4,"Oddly, I have given the cats Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size and they seemed to like it. I bought 2 cases of this 3oz and they only touch it after realizing that I will not give them more food.<br /><br />It may be because I gave them Turkey & Seafood for a while in between. It's odd because they scarf up that flavor, and they would scarf up the Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size. WEIRD.<br /><br />I rate it 5 stars for the ingredients and quality. I always feed them Castor & Pollux. However, as always, test not only the flavor but also the size of the can. When I scoop the food out of the can the consistency in the 3oz cans seems somewhat thicker than the 5.5oz (in all flavors I have tried). This may be a contributing factor to their distaste for this particular combination.<br /><br />Great product, just verify kitty flavor approval."
4,"I cannot get over how much my shy kitty takes to kitty kaviar.  It has to be a staple in her diet.  She just adores, wants, obsesses the stuff."
0,"I love the sweet ginger peach tea. I drink a cup every morning before I go to work and every night before I go to bed. I love it so much that when all of the local grocery stores stopped carrying it, I drove to another city to buy it. And when that store stopped carrying it, I bought it here on Amazon, or so I thought.<br /><br />Turns out that only half of the boxes actually contained Sweet Ginger Peach Tea. Inside of each box is a sealed bag.<br />Last night I opened a box of tea, and opened the bag, made a cup of tea, and promptly spit it out.<br />It wasn't Sweet Ginger Peach tea at all. I couldn't figure it out. I pulled the bag out of the box to find out my box had been filled with a bag of Earl Grey Lavendar tea. Gross.<br /><br />I promptly opened another box to find the same thing. Out of the case of tea, half of it was Earl Grey Lavendar.<br /><br />If this case had been the Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, I would rate it five stars and tell everyone how lovely and soothing it is. But since the order was filled with boxes whose contents had been switched with something completely different, all I can do is say, save your money and your time and order elsewhere.<br /><br />EDIT!! After reading my complaint, Amazon refunded the full cost of the tea to my charge card. Their e-mail stated that they are going to investigate the issue with the packaging. I did not expect such a quick response. Hopefully they will get the issues straightened out and I can once again order this lovely tea!! Love AMAZON"
2,"I introduced this to my daughter and she ate it, no problems!  I certainly recommend it.  One suggestion which I believe helped me was that I DID warm this up. I realize it states you can serve these meal pouches ""as is"", however, I see a difference in my daughter's eagerness when I warm up the food vs. serving it at room temperature. I am very pleased with this product!"
0,"This is a lighter version of Earl Grey tea and has a pleasant citrus undertone and bouquet. When you open the tin (which is well designed, pleasing to the eye and also worth keeping as a container for all sorts of small objects) and look inside, you are pleasantly surprised with a colourful mixture of full leaf black tea, leaves of dried blue cornflowers and small bits of citrus peel. We first tried the tea bags, which were handy, however, we prefer the loose tea.  If you like Earl Grey tea try this one you will like it!"
0,I've tried them all (chai teas) and this is the one I keep coming back to. Excellent all around chai taste without any one spice (like cinnamon in some chais) overwhelming the tea.<br /><br />I highly recommend.<br /><br />Buying it by the case from Amazon is real win too since the price is great and they constantly sell out at the stores in my area.
0,"As a tea-junkie, Runa's traditional guayusa offers a simple, agreeable taste that's not like any other tea I've had. I used to swear by matcha green tea, but Runa is a superior alternative in that it's super-cheap, more energizing, much easier to swallow, and offers just as many health benefits.<br /><br /> Also, if you look into it, Runa's doing some great things on the side of social entrepreneurship and rainforest conservation. I highly suggest reading into it-- it'll make you love the product even more."
2,"I don't know why my toddler is so crazy about these, but he is.  He was snacking on so many cheerios every day that I was desperate to find something else that he would like but wouldn't require refrigeration, and this saved the day.  I feel good about feeding him healthier snacks and he is positively in love with these!"
3,"This is the absolute best hot cocoa for the Keurig Brewers. All of the other Hot Cocoa's that we have tried we had to ""doctor"" to make them taste good. We had to add more cocoa and more sugar. I was pretty much making my own cocoa, which defeated the purpose of the brewer. But the Grove Square Hot Cocoa does not need any help. In my opinion, It has just the right amount of flavor!!"
2,My 18+ month old enjoys this food very much. The texture is fine for him and he finished a whole packet.
1,"These little cans, especially when very cold, are very refreshing.  It tastes great! I liked their blend of kiwi and berry because you can actually taste the kiwi in this drink. The carbonation is just right as well, it adds tanginess without coming back up my nose or giving me gas.  Which I think, is a big plus because it is a common problem many other carbonated drinks have.<br /><br />So they got the flavor and the carbonation right.  However....<br /><br />Personally, I like more than eight 1/2 ounces in a beverage.  I'm a 210 pound guy and when I'm thirsty 8 1/2 isn't going to do it.  But then I looked at the calories --- 134!<br /><br />Holy smokes!  There is only 100 calories in a regular Coke. So I looked at the ingredients expecting the manufacture added a ton of sugar.<br /><br />Nope! All natural ingredients including the lightly carbonated water in Switch drinks. This is also a big plus but at some point I would think they would scale back the fruit juice to water ratio to keep the natural sugar level lower.<br /><br />I think they make a tasty, natural product but it's not for me because its too small and has too many calories."
3,When I got my coffee maker there were only two cocoa cups in the mix of coffee.  How delighted I was for Amazon to offer 24<br />  cup purchases.  Really great idea!
2,My little guy ate this all up before I could even write a review!  :)
4,"I purchase 2 15 pound bags of 9 Lives Daily Essentials a month for my daughter's cats. They love it. She says they often gather around the carton and wait for her to open it. They know what's in there and can't wait for it to be opened. If the cats love it, we love it. Isn't that how it goes?"
0,"I was initially attracted to the Rishi Tea because it is certified Organic - I choose organic whenever possible.  I am already a big fan of Earl Grey teas, and this one did not disappoint.  It is very full-flavored, with a lovely note of bergamot, as one would expect from the best Earl Grey blends.  Enjoy it hot or cold, and do try it without sugar or honey first - it really doesn't need it.  I recommend this product!"
1,"We really have to limit additives and sugar for our son with Autism. Switch Orange Tangerine really fills the bill. He feels like he's getting ""real"" fizzy soda, and mommy is happy it's not loaded with chemicals and additives and actually has real juice in it. A total win-win."
2,I liked these tubs for a few months and then realized that they contain fish oil and gelatin. Why put these products in a VEGETARION seeming food? Beware! I'm going to review all of Gerber's products carefully now. Totally dissapointed with Gerber.
1,"I gave this product the ultimate test, I gave half to my son, who loves sodas and sweet stuff. We both found this a satisfying drink, and one with just the right amount of berry flavor. It is not oversweet, nor does it have that funky aftertaste many ""non-soda"" soda type drinks do. My son gave it his thumbs up and said he would drink it. I liked the flavor combination as well, kiwi and berry, and would buy this product."
4,"I received my cat's treats quickly and the product works very well. The best part is that the cats love it, so I don't have to force them to take their cure for hairballs!"
2,my boys have been eating these for over 3 years now. Recently the box has been redesigned. I like it and it's much easier to open now. It used to have sharp edges and made it easy to get paper cuts. It seems the recipe has changed for the bar. it's softer than what it used to be. The boys still like it. They eat only this all day long if I let them.
2,"My son and I love these. They are so good. My toddler loves to snack so I am always trying to find healthy snacks for him to eat. He loves them. They are great for on the go eating too. Try them, you wont be disappointed."
1,"Previously, I had sampled Lester's Fixins <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079KZ9AK"">Sweet Corn Soda</a>, a rather bizarre beverage.  Now, with Buffalo Wing Soda in hand, I was about to imbibe yet another dubious offering from ol' Lester.  With slight trepidation, I pried the bottle cap off of this evil beverage and took a sniff --""Okay,"" I foolishly thought to myself, ""it smells a little bit strange, but not as bad as I expected."" (I was in denial)!  Finally, I took my first swig...  In reality, it tasted sort of like a citrus soda that had been spiked with a couple teaspoons of hot sauce.  The spiciness gave a slight burning sensation to my esophagus, and a funky aftertaste lingered for a while after I had finished the beverage. Subsequently, ""rot gut"" began to settle in, and any lingering ""open mindedness"" that I still had toward this soda faded away exponentially...<br />As I type this review, the empty bottle sits next to me; I've now become acutely and unequivocally aware of the noxious smell continually wafting from the opening:  An unsettling hybrid scent of hot sauce and sickly sweetness.<br /><br />I like the novelity of this soda, but I don't think that I'll be drinking it again."
0,This tea has an interesting scent in the can.  It's like bergamot overlaid with jasmine or some other unusual flower.  As a brewed tea it's all right but sniffing the dry tea was unpleasant.  I think we will stick with Republic of Tea or Yorkshire Gold.
0,"I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity ""kool-aid"" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price."
3,"I received my order of Grove Square hot cocoa mix today, and was very shocked to see that hydrogenated oil was one of the ingredients in the mix. I have avoided using any products that contains trans fats because of the negative effects on blood lipid levels. I would urge Amazon to require an itemized list of ingredients for all food items listed for sale. If the ingredients had been listed, those of us who have concerns about our health can avoid these products."
0,Do not buy this if you think this will substitute your current uses of PB. I love PB found nothing this mixes with well or betters the taste. I Iove Amazon but ask these 5* ratings be investigated and following up that my review remains published.
2,"My 10-month old hates this! Even when I mix it with the Earth's Best veggies that he loves, he will spit it out. Tried the salmon and the Ratatouille and he hates all of it. Bought three cases of the stuff!!! Now what to do? Will keep on trying it."
2,"My baby loves this salmon combination a lot more than the popular chick chick (which is actually her least favorite). Yes, it does stink... its fish! I don't care for fish myself, smell or taste, but she digs this and its good for her. This brand has a much lower sodium content than plum and sprout and is cheaper on a different website. I make most all of her other foods but am not quite ready to tackle preparing meat so Happy Baby has been great for introducing chicken, fish, beef, and turkey."
0,I searched and searched for a tea that tastes like the tea I get at my favorite Japanese restaurant and I was so happy to discover this brand.  I have turned several friends onto it also.  What I also appreciate is how affordable it is.  Sip and enjoy!
0,"This tea has mostly all raspberry flavours with little to no peach at all.  I added a peach green tea bag when I brew it & a little sweetener.  It's very tough to taste the ""sparkling wine"" flavour, either.  At best, it's a nice raspberry green tea, but it's certainly not what I was expecting & hoping for.  If I bought it from a store, I would have taken it back."
4,Product is good; my cats like it.  But the price just keeps climbing.  I will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food.
1,I like the taste of this drink in many ways it takes me back to my childhood with the orange ice lollies I used to eat as it has a similar flavour. The thing you should be aware of is that although it has no added sugar because it has so much fruit juice it does have a lot of calories.  I also found that the can needed to be bigger as I wanted more at the end!
4,"My 13 year old cat wants to skip meals....all he wants is Whiskas Temptations!  He particularly LOVES the ones for hairball control.  He will find the place that they are stored and either knock then off a table or come to me, put his paw on my hand and look me straight in the eye until I give him.  He likes nothing  better that these treats! Got a good deal for them on line...saved several dollars on 32 bags!!"
3,This is a fabulous drink that our entire family enjoys ! It has just the right combination of spices and chocolate.
1,"Think kiddie juice box with a kick - plus surprisingly flavorful. That basically describes this interesting drink. The cans are 8.3ozs, slim and perfect for toting along. No sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives. This is definitely a good alternative for kids' lunch boxes.<br />Flavor-wise, you definitely can taste the kiwi fruit and strawberry. Considering that most ""fruit"" drinks taste like syrup water, it was nice to have something actually NATURALLY flavored and carbonated so my kids' think they are getting ""soda""when in reality they are getting something infinitely better."
0,"It's not an amazing tea. It's an ""okay"" tea. I buy regular green tea at asia market for way cheaper price and I get same result. I look for saving money. Will not repurchase."
2,"Why, why, why did they change the formula??  Our twins loved this.  Now just like gobble gobble, they wont take it.<br /><br />Company's website with the old and new formula: [..]<br /><br />Only guess is that sweet potato is much more expensive than corn (both the top ingredients).<br /><br />Wrote to happybaby to tell them how disappointed we are"
1,"This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be ""100% juice,"" but this drink has some kick.<br /><br />There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.<br /><br />It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you."
0,"My order did not include boba straws.  The shipper either forgot to put straws in my order, or this picture is misleading.  Otherwise, the tea was delicious, and the boba was easy to make and delicious!"
0,"I had heard about their prickly pear tea in a forum and decided to try it since I hadn't had any since I was in Arizona.  It was better than I remembered!  I tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good.  The company delivered super fast too which was great.  I recommend this tea highly, particularly if you like prickly pear teas."
3,"First, I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate. I'm not really a huge chocolate fan in general - but I've preferred milk chocolate over dark. This chocolate is does not taste anything like other dark chocolates. I find the flavor robust, but in a subdued way (a contradiction, I know). It is hard to describe, but this is one of the best chocolates I've tasted. It has a unique grainy texture that is fabulous. The price (currently $5.99 here at Amazon) is very high though. I pay about 4.59 at a local grocery store (and no shipping charges). I buy at least one per week to feed my addiction."
1,"I was really looking forward to sampling this product. It's not bad, but a little too sweet-tasting for me. Also, at 140 calories for an 8.3 oz can, I thought that was on the high end. But it does contain 34 grams of sugar, and one must remember that fruit juice is not low in calories. I would have preferred more sparkling water and less juice. On the plus side, it has no artificial ingredients or colors. And no corn syrup! I am sure many will like this product more than I, especially those who prefer more sweetness in their beverages."
2,"If baby likes that's what matters! Happy baby! Happy mommy! Only thing is the color of food that stain anything, but, oh, well, just washed right the way!"
1,"I loved it! Good taste, pleasant carbonation, fun can.<br /><br />If you don't like Kiwi or Berry, then you may not like the taste.  My wife didn't care for it, but I really liked it! Ok, so all it is is carbonated fruit juice.... big deal, right? But it actually is a big deal if you are a soda junky and want to cut down on the negative effects without losing all the experience. I hate diet soda because it just doesn't taste right and has way too many synthetic chemicals in it. However, this drink has no sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives. I suppose the CO2 may not be the best for you, but you gotta live a little."
1,"I was looking for a low calorie cocktail and mixed a Rose wine with the Fresca Peach and it was delicious and I am not a regualar soda drinker and don't normally drink Rose wine. Make sure to get a Rose that is not sweet or you might as well drink Kool-aid. Look for off-dry or bone dry Rose's, maybe made with a Syrah, Cabernet, Merlot, Tempranillo, Sangiovese. Zinfandels tend to be too sweet for my taste, but you might like it. A sparkling rose would be great too. You can serve this with ice in a cocktail glass  or without ice in a martini glass."
0,"It looks pretty, but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality. There's a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store. The basket is nice, though."
2,"I love the happy baby and similar brands of organic baby food in pouches, but they have one MAJOR downfall in my eyes- most of the blends are SUPER SWEET. It's difficult to find many pouches with just vegetables, and no super sweet fruits mixed in. I hate the idea of teaching my child that everything MUST taste sweet (spinach, broccoli, peas, etc- they're always mixed with mango, pear, apple, etc- they always just taste like fruit.) I LOVE that he Amaranth Ratatouilli is not sweet at all- it actually tastes like vegetables!! My child loves it. We frequently mix it into other things- pasta, rice, etc. It's great topped with cheese. One bit of warning though- this blend seems pretty acidic, so babies with sensative tummies might have trouble- I would just mix it in smaller portions with pasta or something else."
0,"We've purchased dragonwell green tea from other vendors and the quality has been much better.  Of course we paid quite a bit more for it as well.  This just goes to prove ""you get what you pay for"". This bag has a lot of stems and other debris, so would not recommend.  Pay the higher price and get the better quality tea."
3,"Compared to other k-cup products, Grove Square offers tasty products at a reasonable price.  This hot cocoa was rich and delicious!"
0,I love this tea. This is a wonderful chai blend that's good hot or iced. I use it in my iced tea maker. It's a big hit with our family. Buying it in bulk through Amazon is far more cost efficient than trying to purchase them as single boxes in a health food or grocery store.
0,"A lot of the other reviewers describe this as basic, sort of low-end but decent tea--I think it goes beyond that.  It is strong and it will get bitter if the brewing temperature is too high--so don't let the water boil!  My husband and I have been drinking this tea for years now, and while we've tried much more expensive teas such as Teavana, we keep coming back to this over and over.  It's our favorite and if it's brewed just right it has a tangy, smoky complexity that's just unbeatable.  I always get sick of drinking other teas after awhile, but I never, ever get tired of this one.  I drink it throughout the day--it's good hot or iced.  How nice to find it on Amazon in bulk."
4,"My two boys LOVE the semi-moist Pet Greens treats. Admittedly, Biscuit is not overly choosey, but Chicken has turned up his nose at the other treats I've tried. Now, if I say ""treat"" or even reach toward where I keep them, Chicken comes running. They DO smell weird -- kind of like not-so-freshly mowed grass, but the odor quickly dissipates and the kitties love 'em. So far we've tried the chicken (ironically enough) and the salmon and both have been equally well-received."
1,"I've become a fan of The Switch sodas. The black cherry flavor has a great balance of flavoring and carbonation that had me ready to give up traditional sodas. The Orange flavor; however, leaves a lot to be desired. It has a really strong after taste and despite being ""100% juice"" it tastes like bad artificial Orange flavoring.<br /><br />I'd opt for the grape or the black cherry for sure. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />Also, you'll want to note that The Switch sodas aren't exactly healthy, they are simply not overrun with artificial flavors. They actually have a fairly high calorie count. That being said they have some health benefits over pop- like the vitamin count and no added sugars."
3,"Yuck...WORST ""CHOCOLATE"" I have ever had. Save your money on this brand and find another. Doesn't even taste taste like chocolate; we threw the rest away."
2,"My son loves all of the Happy Baby meals he's tried except for this one. He literally gagged. I think it was the use of peppers in the recipe, as he's not been exposed to peppers yet. He is clearly not a fan so be careful if your child hasn't tried peppers yet...they may not like this one."
2,"My daughter loves them. They are easy to heat up and good for the body and earth. It's the perfect weekday dinner for us busy mums. And it's so clean to eat, that's the key. Not as messy as mac n' cheese. Thanks Peas of Mind to make my life easier."
1,"I was surprised at the ingredient list and ""100% natural"" stamped on the side, because this drink tasted just like a compeletely artifical energy drink. This is going to be a short review for me, because I don't really have much else to say. I could barely tell it was orange, because as with energy drinks it just tastes like an amalgamation of fruits. My wife was especially confused- she gets sick at the smell of drinks like Monster, and she had the exact same reaction here.<br /><br />I know this isn't an energy drink, but for the life of me, I just can't reconcile the taste with the ingredients. If you're the sort of person who drinks some fresh fruit juice and thinks ""I really wish this tasted more like a completely artifical enegry drink instead of natural fruit juice"", then this is the product you've been dreaming of."
0,"I seem to have entered my green tea ""wave"".<br />After years of only black tea, then white, oolong and green tea, I have discovered the loose fruit flavored green tea mixes sold by Teavana, which are delightful. Teavana makes tea drinking a pleasure with all the available accoutrements and utensils.<br /><br />This green tea mix is flavored with apple pieces, hibiscus flowers, rosehip peels, blackberries, and blackberry flavoring, raspberries, plum pieces, cactus blossoms and spearmint and is called Blackberry Mojito.<br /><br />Fruitmixes are nothing new in the tea world, but Teavana's product is most fresh in the vacuum sealed pouches and has a wonderfully delicious fruity fragrance. However as an infusion, I found its slight astringent tartness somewhat objectionable, which most likely stems from the rosehips peel. Perhaps other people prefer this. If compared to the Lipton fruit flavored green and white tea bags, which are available now, and look like little pyramids, I have to say that I do prefer their taste, but as a potpourri Blackberry Mojito is the winner."
0,Part of me wants to ask for a refund. I bought this package of k cups because I wanted a mix of teas. When I got my package I was very disappointed to see hardly any teas in the package. I know they substituted based on availability but I think it's completely misleading to substitutes with products that don't pertain to the packaged theme. I got a mix of gingerbread and eggnog. DISAPPOINTING!
0,"Just received a case of this tea.  It tastes good and a bit on the sweet side, but not overly sweet.  I would give it a higher and better rating if it is not made in China though."
2,My 10 month old baby hates this stuff!!  I've tried giving it to him on 4 separate occasions-but everytime he tastes it--he makes a disgusted look and won't eat anymore.  I even tried mixing it with his favorite foods and he just takes one bite and looses his appetite and won't eat anymore of anything for the rest of the night!
1,"I have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners, and this includes sodas with high fructose corn syrup.  The Switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners--not even cane sugar.  It has carbonated water, fruit juice, some natural flavors and colors, and vitamin C.  If you're going to drink soda, carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go.<br /><br />The Switch has several flavors, including Orange Tangerine.  However, it's clear some flavors are better than others.  The Orange Tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor I tried does not.  I've tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them, but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda.  If you're looking for an orangey soda, try Izze's Sparking Clementine instead."
1,"My 2nd adventure for health into ingesting Aloe.  My first taste had me realizing this was way too sweet to be a health drink.  Upon examination the very small font list of ingredients, I found; 1st Aloe Gel, 2nd Honey(surprising), 3rd High Fructose Corn Syrup... yep... 15 grams of sugars per cup 160ml the bottle that is the size of a small bought water bottle is 500ml... I easily gulped it down before my full study was complete. Down the end of ingredients there is artificial green grape flavor...we all need that...to match the green bottle I guess.<br />  After I mixed it 50/50 with filtered water I was able to actually taste other than sweet and it was not bad with a bit of pulp that I liked as in pulp orange juice.  I added some pure Aloe Juice to get it closer to the health drink I stupidly assumed associated with Aloe... and will make it thru the case I ordered.<br /><br /> I suppose if your looking for a better after school replacement drink than say.. Mt Dew, for one of the many new obese children it may suffice...but keep a tongue depressor handy for surely down the road they will be falling down and shaking at this sugar level as well."
1,"This drink is nice and sweet with some carbonation but not as good as some of the competitors out there. BUT, it is made of real juice and that is a plus. My kids loved it!"
0,"Originally tried this because it was on sale, and I figured that even if it was gross I'd only be out a buck. Happily it tastes great, mainly have used it in coffee and tea. Just ordered my second box."
2,I ordered this ghee for my family while we work at improving our dental health and overall health.  It's very tasty and the kids love it on toast.  It also came REALLY fast which was nice.  I will be ordering more.
2,"My 9 1/2 month old daughter has loved this since she tasted it when she was 7 months.  I have tasted it, and it's delicious.  It's convenient for on the go or to have handy as a snack.  The ingredients are mangoes and &lt;1% Organic Lemon Juice.  The consistency is nice and thick (like that of apple butter) so it isn't dripping off the spoon.  Also if you feel confident enough, you or your child can squeeze it right in his/her mouth.  Ella's products are expensive, but I think their products are worth it, and my daughter has loved every variety we have tried except the pumpkin combo.  Love all the fruits--pears, apples and these mangoes.  This also provides 40% of Vitamin C."
3,This tastes terrible...  Like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate.  The best I have tried so far is Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate K-Cups.  Don't think they are sold on Amazon yet...
4,Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!
1,"Great idea, carbonating fruit juice. Wife & I enjoyed the watermelon strawberry version better, though; it didn't seem to have the aftertaste and slight heaviness of the kiwi berry. Nonetheless it was quite good."
1,"Not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about.  This root beer tasted fine.  Not the best I've ever had, but husband has a bad reaction to artificial sweeteners EXCEPT for Truvia.  He drank most of the 24 pack that we bought and wants me to buy 48 more cans, which I will after I post this.  It's a bit expensive, but the Truvia is worth it for us."
2,"I can't get my 10 month old to eat any ""dinner"" type baby food.  I thought this would be different, but it's not.  Baby doesn't like it, so it's no good to me.  Not sure what I am going to do with the other 15 packs."
0,"I love the aroma and the taste of the fruit and vanilla combo, and the addition of ginseng for an added energy boost rounds this tea out nicely for me. It's a sweet tea, which makes it a wonderful healthy alternative to desert after dinner.<br /><br />I see that others didn't like it, but it's really a matter of personal taste...different courses for different horses!"
1,"This product is tasty -- it's carbonated juice (a blend of several juices, mostly apple, grape, tangerine). But the 8.3 ounces costs $1 and contains 140 calories. This is a little rich for me, both economically and calorically. I would recommend this for someone who doesn't mind spending their money and calories on juice."
0,love the ease of having green natural tea anywhear any time . tastes great i love this stash green tea
3,"The most chocolatey and smooth hot cocoa ever, Yum! It has the best price and taste for the Keurig K-Cup Brewer. Way better then at least 3 other peicer brands--we've tried different ones and this is the best and super super fast delivery. Thanks"
0,"This is a great tea. Loose leaf tea is to tea what whole bean is to coffee. The first thing I noticed upon opening the can was the aroma. It was rich and full. The tea is wonderfully dried with consistently large pieces with some white tips evenly dispersed.<br /><br />The tea steeps nicely with wonderful, but not overpowering, flavor with only slight hints of bitterness often found in Earl Grey. The Bergamot was not too strong and added nicely to this great cup of tea."
0,"As soon as I opened the teabag envelope, the smell was truly Divine Nasal Candy :-).  As good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled, the tea proved to be rather bitter.  I may have steeped it too long, so will see if the bitterness abates steeping less.  However, as I prefer milk or cream products in flower teas, the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had.  Lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea.  I suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea.  Will definitely reorder."
2,"I introduced my daughter to Earth's Best Organic Turkey Vegetable Dinner at 4 months. A bit early, but she's advanced, as she was 6 weeks overdue.  She loved it at first.  But, I bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite.  I've tried some of it as well.  Of all of them, this is also my least favorite."
2,"Organic foods of course are best for your health and starting your baby on foods that are pure is best no matter what. I highly recommend Earth's Best products. He loves the formula, foods and diapers. I love the products because it's best for my baby. I wish I knew about organics and Earth's best 16 years ago with my first baby."
4,"My cats (who are different in almost every way) totally agree on this food - its healthy so i dont feel guilty spoiling them, they slurp all the juices, nom all the real meat, chomp the nuggets and veggies and lick their lips forever after ! I am a huge fan of all Merrick foods but the Pot Pie, Turducken, Thanksgiving Dinner, and California Roll are my cats' favorites!"
0,"I never write reviews but this tea is worth taking the time to write about.  I'm an avid coffee drinker, trying to kick the coffee habit and tried this tea.  Wow! I love it!  The big plus is you don't need to use any sweetner as it is naturally sweet!  Is my new favorite drink, hot or cold!!!!"
1,"I appreciate the effort for going the healthy route, unfortunately this totally destroys the taste.  I had the regular root beer by Blue Sky before, at least it was decent.  While the taste of this is so bland that I don't know how to describe it, the only way to make it bearable is by adding a packet of Splenda for every can."
1,"This is a beverage that is different from the other beverages out there.  It starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet.  I was hoping for the zing to continue or get more full but it died.<br /><br />The overall taste is not as sweet as an orange soda and not as citrus as an Izze or similar citrus beverage.<br /><br />Overall, this is in between and as such is not going to be my pick as I will usually want one or the other.<br /><br />Not bad, but not what I want."
3,"This is great hot chocolate.....Not watery like some others and my husband really likes this one.....Thank you.  Pat Greenough, Boise, Id."
2,I love Earth's Best. My son eats almost all of the Earth's Best single and combination foods. This pack in particular has two of his dinner/lunch favorites: Summer Vegetable and Brown Rice and Lentil. Some of the dinners and a lot of the first purees are very runny so we mix with some cereal to thicken.
0,"Arrived nicely packaged and sealed. An aromatic, lovely tea that I love to blend with others to make custom iced tea blends. I love this Oolong orange with fruity black teas. Recommended!"
0,Another delightful tea from Yogi Tea with rich sweet flavor.  Use two bags and enjoy a great dessert without sugar for the low carb lifestyle.
0,"This is my first experience with antioxidant-rich white tea.  Also, I like the fair trade and organic labels.  Since I prefer mild teas, the subtle, honey-like sweetness and floral, fruity notes of white rose tea are immediately pleasing.  A stronger brew intensifies the rose flavor, but the tea remains smooth without bitter tannins often found in green and black teas.  The white tea and rose blend is exquisite - a wonderful, soothing treat by itself or with dessert.<br /><br />This has become my favorite tea!"
1,"I had previously imbibed a couple other flavors of Switch beverages, and I liked them a good bit.  This one was not bad, but certainly unremarkable.  The kiwi flavor was not very prominent, and I had to really try to distinguish that there was any kiwi flavor at all.  The berry is more what I tasted.  Since I'd like the other flavors so well, I was expecting I'd like this one as well, but I didn't even bother finishing the drink.  Other people might like it better, but I found it to be too sweet and not all that worthy of drinking."
3,"I originally received this Mint Truffle hot chocolate as a gift, and was a little bit dismayed that the instructions say to mix it with water, because in the past that always results in a weak flavor. Amazingly, that is not the case with this mix, even with no milk added this has a great rich, chocolate-mint taste.<br /><br />Because it doesn't require milk, I can keep it at work for a warm-up drink on cold office days. I usually put 4 teaspoons of mix in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002P6855Y"">Aladdin 16-Ounce Recycled and Recyclable Tumbler, Lily</a> then add hot water from the dispenser at work for a perfect mug of hot chocolate."
0,"I had already tasted Citron Oolong a few years ago in Barefoot coffee shop in Palo Alto, CA. It is a delicious tea. My friends even enjoyed it. It is not a heavy oolong tea, or even the traditional oolong such as Iron goddess of mercy or Jade oolong, both of which are my ultimate favorites. Also, know this: Rishi makes the best oolong tea so do not skimp on your tea :)! Be sure not to overbrew, and follow instructions on how much to use. Also use filtered water to boil, it will improve the taste over tap water. I love using my brita water in the zojirushi which has hot water ready to go at all times at my house."
1,"Like the other flavors of The Switch, Kiwi Berry is sweetened with a mixture of fruit juice concentrates which can lend to it's overly sweet taste. Although this flavor wasn't as sweet as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, for me it wasn't as good as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Although I can't see buying this drink for myself, my kids do like it.  I think The Switch might be best billed as a healthy alternative to soda for kids mainly because the flavors are much more geared towards that age group."
1,"I thought it had a bitter orange flavor, however my husband and friend liked it."
0,The Genmai Cha tea I purchased is quite wonderful.  It takes a few cups to get hooked on its delightful flavor but then it's terrific to start off a day with. I use honey and sometimes a bit of cream which adds to its richness.  I recommend it highly to tea enthusiasts.
0,"Great flavor, easy to dispense, and a nice metal canister!  I'm not a big connoisseur of teas, but the fact that it was green tea helped me decide to try it.  And, for the nice price, I'm glad I did.  Will be nice to give a canister away here and there to friends and family."
1,"If you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar, then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda. The flavor is more heavily tangerine (which only makes sense). It isn't overly sweet, which is a good thing."
0,"This tea has been a favorite in my family for years. It's difficult to find locally, so I was so happy to find it at the Vitamin Shoppe and at such a great price. It's a spicy tea, great with toast or crackers or just by itself.  If you like Chai, you'll love this bolder version."
1,"This small can of juice is tasty! The carbonation makes this beverage very delightful, and the juice is not too sugary. It is good to see this drink in the market. Although I would have liked a larger size container so I could drink more at a time, The Switch drink is loaded with Tangerine goodness! Hooray!"
2,"These are no good. I got them thinking they would be a great snack with cheese or meat or jelly...  My kid won't eat them at all and I don't blame him.  They have no flavor, and nothing seems to help. I wouldn't buy them again."
4,"I honestly cannot say that I saw any difference whatsoever in this variety compared to Friskies regular sliced beef version.  Actually, my cat preferred the regular Friskies over this one.  He's not really all that jazzed over these Fancy Feast varieties anyway, so if you're going to buy this one or the chicken, save your money and buy the regular Friskies versions.  They seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money.  I've never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so I guess I'll get the special ones instead."
1,"I've tried other flavors of Switch before, and I think this one (Kiwi Berry) is my favorite. The flavor is much better than Red Bull or Rockstar, which I've consumed my fair share of over the years. It's more like a carbonated fruit drink than an energy drink. I will definitely be purchasing more of these Switch beverages. I like all the flavors I've tried so far. If you are tired of the way energy drinks taste, maybe it's time for you to make the ""Switch""."
0,"When I read the other review of this tea, I had to write.  This tea has a wonderful, balanced flavor that mixes the tartness of raspberry and the sweetness of peach to come up with a smooth blend.  I usually want a little honey in my tea, but this one doesn't really need it.  Makes a great iced tea, too!"
3,I bought a can of Stephen's hot cocoa over 5 years ago not realizing how good it was going to be. After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.
2,"Expired and broke my daughters braces,<br />She should not have been eating it in the first place lol but they were as stale as a rock!!"
2,"I bought these last month as part of an Amazon promotion - buy 5 items get %40 percent off.  I had never heard of this product, but have a soft spot in my belly for the snacks I grew up on as a kid.  These things turned out way better than expected.  They are essentially pork rinds from your typical supermarket, but they are fresh - still crackling and popping after you open the bag.  I'm addicted to these now and have had to ratio them out so I don't eat them every night.  They're THAT good."
0,I first tried this tea at at French restaurant that had ran out of the usual black tea with mint. To my surprise this tea beats any tea (without milk).. no sugar needed. It is naturally sweetened!
1,"I really enjoyed the Switch.  It was a lot more carbonated than most sodas and stayed that way until I finished it.  I was also surprised that no sugar was added since it was sweet and had real crisp, tangerine taste.  It was similar to Sunkist pop but it tasted more like real juice.  I enjoyed the taste and if you have the extra money and want a healthier alternative, you might want to give it a try, but it is still 140 calories per can.  So it isn't exactly a diet drink.  And the price for the Switch is about 4 times the cost of most soft drinks so I think it would be out of the range for most people's pockets."
0,"This tea was not what I expected.  I love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product.  The tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which I enjoy.  This tea has a stronger Rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor.  Furthermore, I found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea's ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients listed on the box include:  Cinnamon, Licorice Root, Orange Peel, Indian Sarsaparilla, Chicory Root, Rooibos, Natural Flavors, Star Anise, Almond Extract and Locorice Extract"
0,"Revolution's White Pear Tea is my most often repeat/requested tea by guests. People just love it, with or without half & half. The pear flavor is pleasantly accurate- natural taste. Very appealing! But when adding this tea to your collection, don't forget Teaosophy's Black Kerala (an absolute 5 star black), Teaosophy's Darjeeling Green and/or Two Leaves and A Bud's Tamayokucha Green. Finish it with a good quality monkey picked oolong and you will have the best of the beloved Camellia sinensis plant!"
0,"First, I readily admit this is a pricey tea, but honestly, I've come across the same quality tea in teashops that is much more expensive, and they're not organic or fair trade products.<br /><br />This Earl Grey blend is smooth and delicious! I didn't use as much as the instructions said because it was too strong/bitter for my taste buds. Using half of what they said produced a lighter, smoother tea. One note: Upon first sniff of the tea leaves, the citrus note is STRONG, but it's more balanced in the flavor of the tea.<br /><br />The packaging is nice and keeps the tea fresh.<br /><br />The size of the tea leaves is adequate. I don't end up with a lot of ""tea dust"" at the bottom of my cup. This ""tea dust"" does increase as you use the tea and get farther down in the tin (I assume this is because the smaller pieces naturally tend to settle toward the bottom of the packaging in shipment).<br /><br />Overall, a nice blend! I recommend adding a little dried lavendar blossoms to create a wonderful Lavender Earl Grey."
1,"This carbonated product has a nice natural juice taste to it that makes you feel like you're drinking something that might be a little healthier than all the other carbonated stuff out there on the shelves but I couldn't help but notice the amount of sugar this thing has listed on the nutrition facts:<br /><br />34g per 8.3 oz can of the stuff. 36g total carbs.<br /><br />Like I said, it's good but don't get fooled into thinking its any healthier for you. There's no artificial stuff in here according to the can at least."
1,"Of the four flavors this product comes in, this is my fav. It is light, fruity, and refreshing. There is no weird taste, no bitterness. I'm willing to give up the 100 plus calories this has per serving to get 100% of the RDA of vitamin C and feel really refreshed. I think this product is so good because there is no sticky sweetness, no heaviness like regular juice has. The carbonation and the proportion of the various juices fits my palate perfectly. I would love a larger serving, but the calories would get out of hand. I may never go back to straight juice again."
2,"I purchased these for our 10 month old twins a while back and they absolutely loved them. They are now 13 months and still love them. They prefer them over the HappyMelts, even though they like those as well. Below is my pro/cons list:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Both babies love them<br />They are overall healthy, have less sodium, etc than other products of the same type of snack<br />A lot of munchies in each container<br />Great price on Amazon with Subscribe & Save<br /><br />Cons:<br />They are messy as they easily crumble and there are a lot of tiny crumbles in the bottom of the container<br />This particular flavor is sort of flavorless to me, however, my twins seem to disagree with my taste buds"
4,"Although a bit hard for my cat to chew at first, she loves them now and can't wait to get her treats!"
0,The tea is good and fresh. We enjoy it. The shipping is fast and cost is reasonable.<br />I recommend this product.
0,"I buy this tea for my wife. This is perhaps her favorite tea. Much like Earl Grey tea, but with a stronger floral taste. Of course, anything from Twinnings will always be of high quality. The price from Amazon is very good, so no reason not to buy and enjoy."
1,"I was completely put off by SWITCH KIWI BERRY. Another entry into the already boring sparkling juice market, this flavor not only lacked anything new or interesting, but went a step further in its poor flavor.<br /><br />I didn't really taste kiwi, and the ""berry"" was bland and unidentifiable (raspberry and strawberry, according to the ingredients list); it was, like most of these juices on the market, mostly apple and grape and not much in the way of uniqueness. In fact, the can I tried actually had a metallic flavor to it--I don't know if it was actually picking up the tang from the container, or if it's just the poor flavor profile of the beverage. I really don't care enough to try it again to find out.<br /><br />Also, I don't know why they're calling this line SWITCH. It's probably a marketing thing--they want people to ""switch"" from IZZE or whatever they currently drink. I won't be switching anytime soon, at least not for this boring, low-quality drink."
0,"This tastes just like the iced tea you buy at Starbucks. I like it better because I make it with purified, filtered water. Great tea"
2,He likes to see which character is on his fruit snack. Betty Crocker Fruit snacks are among the best.
3,"This is hands down the best tasting k-cup hot chocolate available.  The Cafe Escapes or whatever the brand name is tastes very watered down and artificial, while this one tastes thicker and milkier.  I love the dark chocolate flavor, although if I didn't know it wasn't dark I probably couldn't have told the difference between it and a regular cup of cocoa.  I will stick with the flavor just because it will probably be richer than the milk chocolate option.  These are such a hit at my house when the weather is cool.  Everyone always wants hot chocolate!<br /><br />Something to note on this is that these work much better when used with about 6 oz per k-cup.  I use 2 k-cups per mug and the flavor is much better than when I try one (too watery)."
0,"I didn't exactly know what to expect when I ordered an affordable bag of bulk, whole-leaf, organic tea. Each of these qualities seemed to clash with the ""1 pound for 16 dollars"" quality.<br />I'm pleasantly surprised.<br />Pros:<br />Tastes great with a lot of forgiveness in brew time (you almost have to try to make bad batch).<br />Nice, resealable packaging.<br />Back to the flavor, it's malty with a astringency and sweet (sort of how sugar tastes, with out the sugariness) quality very reminiscent of a darjeeling.<br />Holds up well to milk and/or honey.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Seems a little weak, doesn't handle multiple infusions very well.<br /><br />Recommendations: order away, expect a pretty solid, consistent, enjoyable tea."
1,"Very good lemonade mix.  Close to fresh in taste.  Love that it has stevia.  I like it so much more than crystal light or any of the other mixes with artificial sweeteners.  I can take it anywhere, mix it in bottled water, and have a refreshing, healthy, safe, cool drink."
4,"My 19 year old cat was on a prescription diet for almost 2.5 years for his reduced kidney function. It was a great food, but the vet that carried it was 45 minutes away and my other 15 year old cat had loose stools with it. So, after reading MANY labels, Royal Canin Mature seemed to be the best one to go with. It's not as expensive as the prescription and it worked wonders for both cats. My eldest has since gone to the Rainbow Bridge to wait for me, but he enjoyed this food until the end. I tried to switch my other cat to a different, less expensive brand that also has lower protein and natural ingredients, but he eats only enough to not be hungry; he is not enjoying his food. So, I'm switching back to Royal Canin Mature. I'm glad to be able to get it from Amazon, it's definitely cheaper than the local, but nationwide, pet chain store."
0,We make most of our tea from loose leaf in a press pot. Sleepytime is the lone exception. We've been drinking this tea for many years now and it still rates among our very favorites. It's the perfect blend of camomile and mint. And you gotta love the bear.
0,I love this tea  --  I have been trying Davidson's teas --  I like just plain unflavored teas -- This is great value too -- It has a smooth taste  - It makes a great iced too --  This tea has a clean simple taste to it  --  I have tried other types of Assam Banaspaty Estate Tea and this has a very good taste to it ---  I have hot water brewer that gets the perfect temp and it helps tea brew correctly  --  If you love loose tea I would invest in hot water brewer --  because it does make a difference in taste of the teas -- there is no guess work on temp -  I am really enjoying these teas from Davidson's  !  I highly recommend to a friend  --
4,"The cats don't like this flavor. I would have preferred an assortment of flavors. The product itself is good. I just have finicky cats. And I am weaning them off wet food, anyway. My older cat is getting too big! Notice I didn't say fat!  ;-)"
0,"I was never much of a tea person.  My experiences with tea have been limited to Lipton, Community, some Bigelow, Celestial Seasonings and whatever brand that happens to be in use at the restuarants I visit.  With Rishi's Earl Grey, I ventured into my first loose leaf tea experience.<br /><br />Culled from 1300 year old trees of the Yunnan mountain villages, this Earl Grey is strong, almost sweetened coffee-like in taste.  If there's no coffee around, this tea would be my next choice.  It contains bergamot oil as well.  It has a stout aroma that hits you before you even open the inner lid of the container.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea to fans of dark teas in general, as well as folks like myself who are more familiar with coffee and biscuits than tea and crumpets."
1,"This juice is one of my baby's favorites. I used to buy the 4oz bottles but this is way cheaper. I like the fact that 4oz gives her a serving of fruits. The max amount of juice that babies should drink in a day is 4oz, so I fill up a bottle with equal parts of water and juice and let her drink it with her meals throughout the day. In between I also give her plenty of plain water."
1,"First, I wish I had gotten two can samples of this product so I could try one with some bourbon. I find almost everything mixes with bourbon except tomato juice.<br /><br />OK. What I liked: nice fruit flavor. Strong but not overpowering. The carbonation was OK. Not flat, which was nice. Did not tickle my nose as champagne does.<br /><br />I did not care for the ""can"" taste. I felt there was a slight metallic aftertaste. Really, that was the only thing I didn't like. This product would probably taste better in glass rather than aluminum. Maybe I am overly picky...<br /><br />Overall, not sure I liked it enough to order it again."
0,This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.  It steeps fast and the resulting mug of tea is murky and delightfully aromatic.  I love it and will undoubtedly use every bag in the next month or so.  The one thing I think anyone buying this product should be aware of is that they add stevia to the bags.  I am usually not a fan of stevia (to me it has a bitter aftertaste) but it was not overwhelming here.
1,"I wrote a 5 star review of the Kiwi Berry flavor.  That isn't usually my favorite flavor of anything, but it was surprisingly good.<br /><br />Orange Tangerine (which would generally be among my first picks of fruit-flavored beverages is flat by comparison -- literally.<br /><br />It seemed to lack the right amount of carbonation.  It also tastes weaker and too sweet.<br /><br />Try the Kiwi Berry instead."
0,"I am hooked on Rishi Tea's Earl Grey. After browsing the teaviews site for good Earl Grey Teas, I picked up a canister of Rishi at a local grocery store. But after the first cup, I fell in love! My coworker asks for a cup even when she's not a big fan of Earl Grey. The velvety smoothness of each cup makes me want another. Thus, the 3-pack is a great deal.<br /><br />I can't imagine my mornings with my Rishi Earl Grey."
0,"Boston Tea provides some of the best tasting tea I have found.  I have several flavors on hand (Berry Medley, Strawberry Fields, etc) for the office tea drinkers.  I started out being the only one drinking it and now I have been making 3-4 12 cup pots a day.  So far the Peach Passion is the favorite and the kitchen smells of peaches when I make this one.  It is so good I'm signing up for auto delivery.<br /><br />If you like peaches and tea, this is the blend for you.<br /><br />As a side note I add about a 1 tablespoon of quality black tea to the 8 tablespoons of Peach Passion.  Also, I can brew this twice and still get full flavor (24 cups total)."
4,"This is a great food and my cat loves it! The only thing that seems a bit strange to me is the difference in consistency between batches, and even the difference in consistency between the 3 ounce cans and the 5 ounce cans. Seriously, it looks like a different food, with the 3 ounce cans looking much smoother in texture, and the 5 ounce cans looking much more ""grainy"". I hope that the following review will help someone with a cat that has stomach issues similar to mine...<br /><br />I have tried many, many products aimed at helping with digestive upset for my cat. Her pain and suffering was so great that I thought I was going to have to put her to sleep. I went to multiple vets and had thousands of dollars worth of diagnostics done to try and find out why she was having acid reflux, crying and subsequently vomitting (endoscopy, xray, ultrasound, bloodwork, etc). One vet told me to just give her pepcid. This worked for a while, but then became completely ineffective after a while. The same vet then told me that she probably just has food allergies and would have to be on steroids for the rest of her life, and thats all that could be done, and prescribed different kinds of Science Diet (which we all know is actually a terrible food for cats with digestive problems).<br /><br />Well, what do you know, the steroids didn't help AT ALL. I tried probiotics of various brands for pets, I tried digestive enzymes, I tried many different natural products designed to help ease digestive / intestinal inflammation.... I tried a homiopathic vet (the only one in my area) and spent a few thousand more dollars rerunning tests and running other tests for pancreatitis, etc. I tried MAKING her food from raw meat to try and eliminate food allergies to commericial foods as a potential problem, etc. I TRIED EVERYTHING, but still my cat was constantly licking her lips, then crying in terrible pain and vomitting very consistently, and now was losing interest in her food and was losing weight and starting to look boney. I was determined to not give up on her though. I had just lost my wife to infection during a failed bone marrow transplant / cancer during all this, and was not about to give up on my girl.<br /><br />I stopped making her food and started getting her Natures Variety canned Rabbit formula and the duck formula. She loved the food but it did not seem to be helping her feel all that much better, even though a lot of other people were having great success. I then found a site called wellvet dot com that said that the Ulcinex was very effective at repairing ulcers and the stomach lining in pets. It also said that it was very effective at controlling vomitting that occurs a few hours after eating, which is EXACTLY what was consistently happening, and no other product that I had found so far claimed to do same thing. I was skeptical as soon as it started talking about chinese herbs and such, but I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />I started giving this as prescribed from wellvet ALONG WITH Georges Aloe Vera juice (the one without preservatives and no taste), which is said to help a lot for acid reflux sufferers (I found a few people that said it worked great for their cats), and continuing the rabbit / duck formula. All the while praying, within a few days I started noticing a drastic improvement. She was licking her lips less, and was able to relax for longer periods of time without jumping up in pain and crying. She vommitted once within a several day period. Several days later, NO MORE CRYING, and instead of hiding behind the bedroom door licking her lips the whole night, she started sleeping with me at night like she used to. Now, several weeks later, she is literally 90% better. NO MORE VOMITTING AT ALL, is in very little pain, VERY little lip licking and only very occasionally at that. She also gets much more rest, and has put on several pounds and is back above her normal weight and has a nice chubby belly. My cat suffered daily for 2 long years during this whole process before I found this and the other two mentioned products. The aloe vera juice on its own didn't seem to completely do the trick, so I think its the combination of the three things that is really effective. I only hope that no permanent damage has already been done, but now I have my cat back and don't have to suffer through losing a great wife and a great cat. If you have a cat with severe stomach issues, you owe it to yourself and your cat to try this along with the Georges Aloe Vera and Ulcinex.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IICOM"">Metagenics - Ulcinex - 90 Tablets</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV9TA0"">Warren Laboratories - George's Aloe Vera, 64 fl oz liquid</a>"
0,Its hard to beat this for making iced tea. It makes a strong tea that manages to quench a thirst on a hot day. Just dont steep is too long or it will get bitter (I find that 4 mins is about perfect.)
2,My daughter and I both loved this bread!  This was our first time trying it and I was a little hesitant but we both thought that it was delicious!
1,"One of my longtime favorite drinks is a half-and-half combination of club soda and fruit juice. Most fruit juices by themselves are a bit too sweet for me (even the ones without added sugar), and the addition of carbonation just makes the whole thing more agreeable to me. This drink does this for me, and amazingly, they do not add a boatload of sugar. Too many off-the-shelf beverages--even those claiming to be healthful--have way too much sugar (or worse, the cheap corn syrup sugar substitute). These guys give it none of that. It's both tasty and refreshing. This is a product I would actually buy."
1,My first time having soda flavored candy. It breaks into a powder on the first bite and really does taste like the Ramune soda. It is also fun to find the ones that have little faces on them.
1,This drink was pretty good to me. It has a light not too sweet taste to it and makes you want to drink more than one at a time. What was really good to me is it is light on the carbonation also. All these factors put together means i would try the drink again and recommend it to others.
4,"My two feline food critics just love these sardines, and I love being able to give them these sardines. Each tiny can is stuffed with great big chunks of sardine, and my cats are in heaven when they get this for dinner. This is super high quality cat food, a huge treat for any pampered pussycat out there who likes fish. It makes a very nice change from all the tuna based foods out there, and I try to always have some on hand so I can vary my cats' diet."
4,"My cat loves these! When I take the container out, she get super excited and eats every last flake I give her. She's a very picky eater, and I've never seen her so happy with a treat before."
1,"I spent some time searching for an alcohol free rum flavor to make daiquiri sorbet, and LorAnn has produced the best flavor thus far (which tastes outstanding).  It blows away the competitors that I have tried.  Baking with it has not yet been attempted, but I imagine there would be similar results.  The price is quite reasonable for a 4 oz bottle, although it is much more so if multiple bottles are ordered (save on shipping).  It has natural and artificial ingredients; I would prefer it to be all natural, but that's a price I'm willing to pay for the flavor.  I predict this will remain my alcohol free rum flavor of choice."
3,"After trying several of these k-cups, we threw the rest of the box away.  It only ever created flavorless brown water.  We then tried the Grove Square dark chocolate cocoa k-cups, and were much happier."
1,"The reviews complaining of aftertaste, and just labeling it the ""New age Natural sweeteners"" Have never tasted real root beer, made with real birch root and not just flavoring. The aftertaste they are complaining about with this soda is the complex Birch oil aftertaste (in any real old recipe). I used to live in Quarryville, Pennsylvania and my neighbor showed me and my family how to make Birch brew with the cleaned roots, and the aftertaste is the same here. We live in a society with everything watered down to the point it all tastes like nothing with sugar added.  This is the best commercial root beer I have tasted sugar or not."
3,My kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when I found these so reasonably priced I decided to give them a try.  We all loved them.
4,"We recently adopted a shelter kitten and our vet recommended several natural food brands that she felt were superior to our regular supermarket cat food.  As we feel our new addition deserves the best we can give her we not only wanted to make sure her regular food was of high quality and good for her but as our vet said, don't forget to check that her treats are high quality/natural too.  As we were already purchasing the Wellness brand from her list, we tried these treats.<br /><br />On first glance I thought, wow, almost $5.00 for this little bag, that's pricey, but they are very small jerky type treats and they last a long time if you are only giving your pet a few at a time.  My cat loves these and we have found that her coat seems to be very shiny and silky-not sure if these treats contribute, but they could.  We love the fact that they don't have corn, wheat, soy or a bunch of other stuff she really doesn't need.  We also used these treats as a training incentive to teach her to sit for a treat....it worked!  People laugh, but now we call her and hold up the bag and she looks up at her treat and sits down.  If you don't give it to her right away she walks closer and sits again....smart kitty and she loves those treats.  This is the first flavor we tried, but have since tried others and she loves them all.<br /><br />If you would like to try something more natural for your kitty, I would give these a go.  We have been more than pleased and these are now the only treats we consider buying for her."
0,"I'm a fan!  This tea is not bitter, and forgives a wide range of temps and steep times.  In fact, my favorite way to drink it is to throw a bag into room-temperature water to flavor the water.  This works well through 3-4 refills, by which time I tend to forget and leave the room.  Steeping for hours does finally bring the bitterness out, so that's when I toss it.<br /><br />The ""green"" flavor of the tea is much stronger than most white teas.  It reminds me of a white and green 'fusion' tea by Stash, though I prefer this Revolution tea.  The pear flavor is delicious, tastes like real pear, and matches the strength of the strong white tea (that sounds funny as I type it - strong white tea?!) well.  If you like green AND white tea, and you like pears, give this a shot.  I'm really very fond of it.<br /><br />The package comes with a ""resealable freshness bag,"" though I've never felt the need for one before and I'm not sure I need one now.  It doesn't get in the way, and it's there if I want to travel without risking leaking tea dust . . . not that there is any tea dust.  The tea leaves are as large as loose leaf tea, which might be why it holds up through more steeps than anything else I have in a teabag, and they're very green.  I suspect it still has more moisture in the leaves than most teas, but since I'm reluctant to rip a bag open to perform tests, that will remain a suspicion.<br /><br />There's no string on the teabags, and they're the fancy pyramid type.  They feel very nice.  This is a distant concern compared to the flavor (which, as I mentioned, I am very fond of), but it's worth a mention.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
0,"I really like this tea, but my husband smelled it and commented that it smells like Robitussin cough syrup.  The taste is more subtle than the aroma.  Overall, this tea tastes good and is a good value.  It's not the best tasting cherry vanilla or cherry tea I have ever tasted, but I would purchase it again."
3,"From Nestle comes Abuelita an excellent hot chocolate for those Fall and Wintry days.  This is sugared dark chocolate with a hint of cinnamon.  Each box comes with six tablets.  The best way to serve is to heat four cups of milk, break up one tablet, put milk and chocolate in blender, and blend approximately one minute.  I have the standard powdered hot chocolate in the cupboard but my kids seem to go for the Abuelita first.  They add one broken tablet and milk into the Cocomotion and in a few minutes they are in hot chocolate heaven.  Abuelita has a homemade dark chocolate taste that is not found in most conventional powdered brands.  This a product that is well worth keeping on hand for those hot chocolate days."
1,"I could not finish this drink, it is like drinking orange syrup. It may not have any added sugar in it but one can of 8.3 ounces has 34 sugar grams and 36 carbs. I'll stick to water when I want to quench my thirst!"
1,"Overall, this is a nice, light, refreshing drink. The sweetness is a bit sweeter than Juice Squeeze, but not as sweet as Hansen's soda. I tried two flavors: this orange tangerine, and the strawberry watermelon. I preferred this orange one. The flavor was ""cleaner."" But, there are so many different juices in both those drinks, it kindof gets ""muddied."" I think I prefer Juice Squeeze because the flavor seems true-er. My 10-year-old daughter prefers Hansen's, because it is a bit sweeter. But, like I said, overall, this is a very nice drink. No corn syrup. Yea!"
2,We are huge fans of earth's best.  My daughter loves them.  It's a great variety.  I would definitely reccomend this
0,"Wow!  If you enjoy Earl Grey tea - this one will knock your socks off!<br /><br />The fragrance will start you salivating - or running from the room, if, like my husband, you do NOT care for this flavor/scent!  Once I popped open the well-sealed tin, I knew I was going to like this tea.<br /><br />I use a French press to make my tea, followed the excellent instructions on the tin, and sat down to sip my way through my first cup - then another - yes, the leaves are ""re-usable"" for a couple of cups at least.  It makes the higher price tag a little more palatable - but keep in mind this is organic and fair trade too, which always adds a little to the price tag.<br /><br />It's tea that tastes great and that you can feel good about drinking.  It's now on my ""must have"" list!"
4,"If you are a farmer with lots of farm cats, this is the perfect food - and because it is primarily sold at most farm and fleet stores I think that it is meant for farm cats. The ingredient list is marginal quality though, which can be expected. Most of it is corn and grain products, with a few meat by-products here and there. Better than Iams but not by much.<br /><br />I've been feeding my cat on Diamond Maintenance for 2 years without a problem but I will be switching to something with more substance soon. If you're looking for a cheap option for lots of cats, this is a good product to buy in bulk; but if you have a domestic cat you wish to keep around for awhile, I'd suggest something else.<br /><br />And hey, if you're looking for a good alternative, get Chicken Soup For The Adult Cat formula. Great stuff, doesn't cost a lot, and is much better than the regular Diamond food."
0,"This peach flavored diet tea by Snapple is extremely refreshing after a long summer's day! It's truly a diet tea--there are zero calories. It's best served chilled; and it has a mild but not overwhelming peach flavor to it that is just right. Snapple makes this with green and black tea leaves; there's also a mild green tea flavor mixed in with the peach flavoring. They use filtered water as well. This tea is sweetened somewhat with Aspartame; but Snapple adds in just the right amount so that it's not excessively sweet. If you want really tea that is rather sweet, you'll either have to look further or use this with added sweetener. It also contains phenylalanine and it is kosher if these are dietary concerns for you.<br /><br />If you have other questions, the company has a toll free number so that people can contact them.<br /><br />Overall, this tea is perfect for a hot summer's day when you want something cool to refresh yourself and whet your whistle. I highly recommend this product."
2,"My baby loves this stuff. It is a great texture and actually reasonably tasty. I like that he gets some protein, and that the flavor combination isn't as boring as some."
1,"The product description says it's ""just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C."" Doesn't that sound good? I decided to try the Kiwi-Berry flavor, but anyone reading this review should know that The Switch is not the sort of product I buy, and my opinion may be influenced by that fact.<br /><br />The good points: It's got a nice gentle fizz. And yes, it's juice, made from concentrates. Sparkling water and apple and grape juice concentrates head the list of ingredients. All natural, which presumably makes it healthier than soda. No added sugar (BUT see below, how could they possibly add any more?) And it's fortified with 100% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Not being clear about the term Daily Value (DV), I looked it up and found that it's a dietary reference including -- well, let's just say that it includes the information formerly given by the U.S. RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) but you have to do some math.<br /><br />The not-so-good points: Sugar, 33 grams. Carbs, 34 grams. Calories, 135. All that packed into a slim 8 ounce can, not really enough of it to quench much of a thirst. No taste of kiwifruit that I could notice. Not a crisp natural taste, and way too sweet for me. I had to dilute the last third of it with water.<br /><br />I didn't fall in love with The Switch and won't be switching to it. It may have a place as an energy drink, but that's too much sugar for children or for anyone, really. Do yourself a favor: eat an orange and drink a glass of cold filtered water. You'll enjoy it more and your body will thank you.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2009"
3,"I'd never heard of this brand but they were very cheap here on Amazon and I was extremely surprised at how good the Dark Chocolate Hot Cocoa is.  Absolutely worth trying, it's really quite good."
4,"A good range of reviews here. I especially like the one that seeks to educate. That is unfortunate there are no more canneries here in the States.<br /><br />Here's my reality:<br /><br />I believe this company is out to put out quality products. And if your really concerned about their business practice do some due diligence. They have a website.<br /><br />I stopped for years eating anything out of a can. And for a single person I can't afford buying wild fish in bulk. I love the fact that this company puts out this product. Being of a Pacific Island decent (born and raised in the U.S  and proud to buy american) the food my ethnic community eats is a horrible combination with all that msg and salt. Not all asians eat vegetables. Particularly Filipino's. They fry everything and eat too much bread. It's the spanish influence. I respect their dietary choices but it didn't work for me.<br /><br />About 10 years ago I gradually shifted my health. I believe in moderation. And I do research the companies I buy from. I've never considered sardines. Then I tried the Sardines in Olive Oil and I am hooked.<br /><br />I study the health benefits of all things. I've been doing it for 10 years now. I study psychology and do yoga.<br /><br />Health first comes from your mind. It comes down to testing and learning what your body likes. It doesn't help to scare people into health. It doesn't work in the long run. I've met health freaks that worry so much about the negatives that it physiologically affects their health. There is such thing as too much information. You have to enjoy what you eat. Simple.<br /><br />I eat this stuff out of the can. The flavor is fantastic. It's great with some brown rice and veggies. I haven't quite made the transition to totally raw and I don't think I ever will but this is the next best thing.<br /><br />Price is not comparable to the price of your health. Most don't know how to measure that. The way I watch people waste their money on things like eating out, booze and claim they save money to buy one dollar microwaveable meals doesn't compare. Those ""frugal"" individuals suffer long term when they get older. They are the same people that poke fun at folks like me who take supplements and do yoga. I see a long term investment that most people tend to neglect: YOUR BODY! Your health needs to balance on ALL levels: mind and body. That's when you reap the benefits.<br /><br />If you want great healthy food for an affordable price and still support the planet, then support this company. Your body in the long run will thank you for it."
2,"My daughter will start school this fall and i was concerned about lunches and fruit-to-go choices. We've bought several different fruit pouches at a local organic store and she and I loved these the most. It it not overly sweet (and a strawberry variation as well), tastes really good. She can easily eat 2 of these every day.<br />I really like the fact that it has no sugar and color added + it is organic. Just fruit puree.<br /><br />I, personally, don't like banana variation, but it's just because of my own personal preferences (i like fresh bananas more than cooked), other than that, my daughter approved all of flavors to 10 stars."
0,"If you have friends who love Earl Grey tea, buy this as a gift for them.  They will thank you over and over.  It's the best Earl Grey I've ever had."
0,I got two Teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were HOLIDAY COFFEES and APPLE CIDER!  Spicy Eggnog? Gingerbread? Bait and swtich.  The only redeeming factor - Amazon was great and issued me a refund.
3,"i have tried many brands of the hot chocolates but this by far has been the best.  now, i realize it is thousand percent cheaper to just use the package you can buy at the store and add water but if you want to impress than this is the product."
2,"I thought I was doing my kid a favor when I invested in a case of Earth's Best dinners.  Unfortunately, the second ingredient (after water) for all of these is....applesauce.  Or in the case of the ""Sweet Potato & Chicken"" variety, it's sweet potatoes, followed by apricot puree.<br /><br />After getting used to the sweetness of these (try 'em - they're like jam), it's difficult for kids to adjust to ""real"" food.  From now on, I'm going to stick with just pureeing home-cooked food.  It's a lot cheaper, too."
2,"This is my first time trying Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Baby White.<br /><br />Pros: It's okay with a nice mild nutty flavor. The hulls are more pronounced than with some other Amish ""Baby White.""<br /><br />Cons: It tends not to briskly pop up. In fact, we've burned several pans because popping it is tricky. We found that the microwave often works better than pan popping. And as mentioned above, the hulls are much more noticeable than with other Amish ""Baby White"" brands.<br /><br />We purchased these 6 bags and we'll use them up but won't be ordering any more. Next time we'll drive the long distance to our nearest Amish store."
2,"I really like the ""crunchy"" chocolate chip cookies . . . the soft ones are chemically softened and, I think, gross.  These have good flavor and are great for trips (although eating anything crunchy in the car is discouraged . . . wait for a rest stop!) and especially for preschooler snacks."
1,"So far I've only tried the Orange Tangerine flavor and it's pretty good overall.  It does have a tangerine taste to it, though it's accompanied by other flavors.  It's clearly much more natural than regular soda or those 10% juice drinks since it's just fruit juice concentrates and carbonated water vs. the typical high fructose corn syrup plus artificial flavors, colors and preservatives in something like Sunkist.  I think the juice blend is appropriate for this type of beverage.  It does contain more apple and grape than tangerine or orange, but those first two juices complement the carbonation well viz a viz sparkling cider.  I think straight carbonated orange/tangerine juice would probably be a bit much.  The Switch reminds me of Appletiser, which is one of my favorites and has been around for many years, but is still pretty hard to find in the US.<br />That having been said, I had to dock one star for a couple of reasons.  First, the cans just seem too small.  If they're sticking with aluminum cans, I'd like to see the standard 12oz size offered.  It seems like that would also have the advantage of making it easier to offer in regular beverage vending machines.  Alternately, 16 or 20oz bottles would also work.  The second issue is the price.  While I understand there's a huge difference between the cost of real juice and artificially flavored corn syrup, the current price still seems high, even in comparison to other juice drinks.  That might be partly because it's from a relatively small company that doesn't yet have the giant economies of scale that the likes of Coke and Pepsi can take advantage of, but it still seems like the price could come down a bit (or at least serving size could increase without a price increase) and it could perhaps still be made back up in increased sales volume.<br />I pick up Appletiser when I can find it, and I'll likely do the same with The Switch, at least from time to time."
0,"Now this is a strong cup of tea! But what a delightful taste. Unfortunately I have to limit my intake of black tea, however anyone who enjoys a real honest to goodness pick-me-up without the bitterness of other similar products, will really love this tea. The taste is wonderful and you won't be disappointed."
0,I found this in the organic aisle at my local supermarket.  $[...] for one box of 100 opposed to 3 boxes being sold here with no shipping or waiting.  I would just like to know if anyone knows if this is a good quality for being a bagged tea.  I'm not a Pu-erh expert and I am looking for something as authentic as I can get without paying an arm and a leg.  Can anyone suggest a good quality??  The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is something you can find at your supermarket without buying a pack of 3.
1,"I've found this product (Bob's Red Mill Bicarbonate of Soda or Soda Bicarb without Aluminum) to be just as I'd hoped.  I use it in a 3 to 1 (Pure Maple Syrup to Bob's Soda Bicarb) ration, respectively, as an anti-cancer holistic therapy approach to a recent rise in my (16 year) post-op PSA.  I don't have the results yet, as I'm only in my third week of use.  My next PSA lab test will tell the story.

1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry,<br /><br />After tasting ""The Switch"" in Black Cherry, I was a little reluctant to even try the Kiwi Berry flavor. At this point my expectations were almost non-existent, mostly because I prefer Black Cherry over the taste of Kiwi. So to be fair, I waited until the following day before trying the Kiwi Berry flavor to allow the taste of the black cherry to be completely gone from my taste buds.<br />I actually found the Kiwi Berry taste to be much more pleasing than the Black Cherry flavor. The carbonation fizz was not as pronounced, disguising that cheap wine cooler flavor. I drank this Kiwi Berry down fairly quickly wanting to saturate my pallet to see if I would once again suffer that bad after-taste.<br />Sure enough, there it was. After careful thought trying to come up with an accurate description on paper of what these drinks taste like to me, what I realized was, if you were to take a glass and fill it half way with a cheap wine cooler and the other half with a warm can of beer that was left over from the previous nights party, you would create the exact same bad after taste I seem to get from drinking either the Black Cherry or Kiwi Berry flavor of the ""Switch"" carbonated fruit juice drinks.<br />Only because the Kiwi Berry flavor tasted great going down, I give this drink a 2 Star rating. The really bad after-taste ruins any chance of further purchases for me. I don't care how healthy something may claim to be, for me to buy it; it has to taste good also. Both during and after you swallow it."
0,"This is the real deal. Genmai Cha. Loose green tea and roasted brown rice. Not in bags. Originally known as the ""Peoples Tea"" for those who couldn't afford better. Very popular because of its mild flavor. You can drink it all day long (like I do). You won't be disappointed."
0,"Opening the second, tightly sealed, metal lid on the organic Earl Grey by Rishi Tea, the aromatic fragrance of fresh tea and bergamot citrus which characterize this blend filled the air.  The resulting brew did not disappoint; it was smooth and rich with a citrus tang.  I followed the directions exactly, pouring rapidly boiling water over a tablespoon of leaves placed in my infuser, and allowing it to steep for four minutes. The cup of tea was enhanced by the awareness that, in addition to enjoying the fine flavor, I was supporting an ethnic Chinese family by using an organic, Fair Trade Certified product.  It was a win-win situation - great tea and ecological balance.  (The package was even correct in promising that the leaves could withstand a second steep!)"
1,"According to the side of the can, it's 100% juice with a balance on the carbonation. It tastes great if not for the chalky aftertaste. The low carbonation made it feel less of a soda and more of a juice. I probably wouldn't buy it in the store because of the weird taste."
0,"This tea is to die for.  It hits the spot.  Easy to make ice tea.  All of my friends love it as well.  I am delighted to serve it.  I look forward to drinking it, it is my new favorite drink!"

I just wish it was easier to get the stuff."

4,I'm a profecinal cat trainer and have used several different treats including raw/freezdried raw  home made and comercial treats over the last 10 years. These treats take the cake and run.

Best cat treat on the market. just dont forget to cut them up in little pieces there to big for your average house cat.<br /><br />If you have a finiky cat that dosnt like to eat. well here is your god send. Just crush some up and toss there food in it. Its a garanteed way to get them to start eating again. Dont use a ton since its high in fat.

2,"My 2-year old loves these cheerio-like banana flavored snacks. He prefers them to Cheerios. He has also tried the Blueberry flavored version of these snacks, and highly dislikes them, but I think that's just because he isn't a huge fan of blueberries. These are a hit, though!"

3,"We use our Keurig every day.  When a friend gave us a sample we went crazy, it is the best hot chocolate ever.  I highly recommend this, it is a treat in the evening to take the place of dessert."
1,"The Switch Kiwi Berry is a reasonable alternative for soda pop drinkers who want a more natural alternative and the juice drinkers who want something with a bit more fizz.<br /><br />The taste is somewhere between apple and strawberry though kiwi juice is in the ingredients (maybe I just don't know how kiwi juice tastes!).<br /><br />*** Positive Points Include: ***<br /><br />- Light Carbonation<br />- Made from 100% juice (blend of apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, rasberry, and strawberry, with a bit of vitamin c added.<br /><br />*** Negative Points Include: ***<br /><br />- A bit on the sweet side, then again most juices are<br />- Not a low sugar drink with about 33 grams of sugar<br />- Somewhat high price<br /><br />Overall this should be a good alternative drink for kids who cant seem to kick their soda pop habit.  The carbonation is much lighter than regular soda pop so the damage to teeth will be much less while providing 100% fruit juice."
3,"I originally tried this as a part of a variety pack. I'm glad I didn't buy the whole package. If you like richer hot chocolates, then you will not like this. I tried making this hot chocolate on all three settings (smaller, medium, larger cups on the three option Keurig machines). All of the options tasted too watery for me. I would often add creamer to try to substitute for the lack of flavor to them.  If this is a machine you have in your office and are looking for something different than coffee, it is, like the stars-rating claims, okay. It tastes like what it is - a mediocre hot chocolate they added to a coffee line to simply offer variety.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer to just use Swiss Miss packets and use the Keurig to heat the water. You get better taste (by a company known for hot chocolate) and the convenience of the Keurig machine. Plus, you save a lot of money."
3,"This is okay cocoa. It's not really very smooth, and it's a little watery. I had high hopes, as I love dark chocolate hot cocoa, and the reviews were good. I will finish the box I bought, but will try another brand next time."
1,"The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce can packs a big punch in a teeny tiny can. Touted as a healthy alternative to soda, I couldn't help but taste the similarity between Switch and Coke's Fanta orange drink. The difference however is more than plain. Switch is supposedly 100% carbonated fruit juice with no added sugars. It actually has a pretty good taste -- if it is all natural, then I think kids would love it. I liked the carbonation -- it had tons of bubbles and a light airy feel to it. All in all, I would buy this product again.<br /><br />Natalie S. for Amazon Vine"
4,"I usually give my kitten Catswell treats, because they are straight forward with ingredients, and use cage free chicken.  Well Petco did not have them in stock so this looked like a good alternative. He likes these just as much as the other ones.  I tried giving another cat these treats and he kind of smelled it and walked away, but ended up eating it once it was on the floor."
0,"This will be a short review (for me).<br /><br />I am somewhat of a tea connoisseur, so for me to give a tea 5 stars... well this is a first for me in an Amazon review.<br /><br />Like other reviews of this product, it is a beautiful delight to watch this hand sewn tea unfold in the pot; delicate, thin first flush leaves surround a beautiful red center of hibiscus.  The liquor is a light honey color, and the apricot overtones are pronounced on the palate.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea for anyone who enjoys green (or white)teas; wants to become more familiar with them, or as a gift for someone."
2,This is great!  Organic baby food options - delivered to my doorstep!  The dinners are a good combination and receive a raving review from the bib wearer at the dinner table.
1,"Switch Kiwi Berry Soda:<br /><br />First thing you notice is the light pink color of the soda. It is very lightly carbonated as there are almost no bubbles, yet it is carbonated. It has a pleasant aroma, light yet fruity.  Its taste is also light but sweet. Fruity with definite berry overtones.  There is though, a slight metallic aftertaste. It's not overwhelming but I notice it. The can has just over 8 ounces and may not be a large enough serving for those used to 12 ounce cans. I on the other  hand find myself often spilling out a few ounces of soda so there may be less waste overall, for me.  As in the other flavor I sampled (Watermelon Strawberry) Kiwi , Raspberry and Strawberry are mighty low in the list of juices in the soda. Still I find this flavor far more palatable than the other. I give it 4 stars and find it an acceptable fruit soda."
0,"I prefer to sweeten my own tea and so this is perfect. It makes a strong cup of iced tea, and some may choose to add more water after brewing. Easy to make and great to have around. Taste is very good."
0,"I get around a shipment a week all year round from Amazon, and I can not remember ever writing a review. But I am making a point of expressing my anger over this product. I buy lots of tea from many sources and white peony is one of my favorites. The package says it is organic and of the finest quality. It was possibly the worst tea I have ever tasted. In fact, after a couple of pots, I actually threw nearly the whole half pound in the trash. And the price wasn't even that good. I subsequently bought a pound of excellent organic white peony from Whole Foods for less. Whatever they are, this is not a tea company."
2,"My son is 10 months old and adores Fruit Medley by Gerber.  There are very small chunks mixed in so your baby can start to chew and get used to more solid foods.  Fruit Medley is a mix of peaches, grapes, pineapple, banana, and orange.  A great start for babies beginning to eat more solid foods!"
2,"Little  Duck Organic products are the best finger food. I am so happy I found them for my daughter. I was looking for organic freeze dried fruit for my daughter and just couldn't find anything that wasn't overly crunchy and hard to chew or that didn't get stuck to my daughters teeth when she ate it. Then I found the Little Duck products, the answer to all my freeze dried fruit problems. All 3 Little Duck flavors are so good. I usually share a bag with my daughter! They are the perfect snack for outings when fresh fruit is not an option to bring along. Way to go Little Duck Organics...I recommend your products to all my friends!!!!"
3,"I feel like I've tried every hot cocoa there is in the k-cups.  While I do think this is the best hot cocoa so far, it still isn't great.  I'm not sure what it is, but all of the cocoa k-cups seem to have a weird taste to them.  It's almost like there is artificial sweetener in them,, but I know there is not.<br />I set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa.  This has more body to it than others.<br />I'm still waiting and hoping that Dunkin' Donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k-cup.  There really is nothing better than that.<br />If you want a k-cup hot cocoa, I would def. recommend this over all the others."
3,"To me it seems like too much sugar, not enough chocolate, a little heavy on the spice. Sugar is the first ingredient. But if not for the sugar problem I wouldn't complain about the spice. I tried adding 1/2 pound of powdered cocoa to the 3 pound bag and it was still too sweet. It's amazing to me how far this is from ""the best hot chocolate ever"" like other reviewers rated. Def try a small bag first to see who you agree with."
0,"Recieved the tea very quickly with very  helpful, detailed brewing instructions.  Tea is absolutely delicious!!!!!!  Like dessert in a cup!!!!"
1,"I'll admit that I don't care for drinks that are carbonated - the carbonation in soda makes me burp, they tend to be too sweet, or the diet drinks have a weird taste to them. So I wasn't sure what to expect when I drank this.<br /><br />To my surprise, the carbonation is very mild - it's more like a light buzz in your mouth instead of a lot of carbonation (you won't hear the contents fizz when you drink this stuff). The orange tangerine flavor is a nice combo  - stronger in the tangerine flavor than orange, though as someone who doesn't like any sugar in my drinks, I found it to be a tad sweet (though it is advertised as no sugar added), but less than I expected.<br /><br />I'm not sure when you would drink this though - it's a small can and I can't imagine someone who drinks cans of soda drinking one of these instead - especially at the price they charge for this. Are they thinking that this will replace a glass of orange juice first thing in the morning?<br /><br />Overall I think it's tasty and if someone offered me one, I'd take it, but it's not something I would buy."
0,"I bought this tea many months ago and waited to review it, to see if I really liked it over time.<br /><br />I do.  This tea is really lovely.  The rose scent and taste are just right -- not too lame, not too overwhelming.  I find it slightly calming, even with the caffeine from the black tea.  Of the 6 or so loose teas in my drawer that I regularly use, this is the one I seem to reach for most often.  I'm diligent about brewing times.  This one is 5 min. and I set the timer.  Gives me a perfect cup every time.<br /><br />Don't forget that it's organic.  Support organic practices and do something beneficial for your body.<br /><br />This tea was a good buy and has withstood the test of time (for me)."
0,It's very hard to find this product in local grocery stores. Loose tea is something my wife and I enjoy.
2,"What can you say about baby food?  The ingredients are green beans and water.  But if you've tried buying baby food in any quantity in the grocery store, you know how the jars roll all over the place and are a pain to transport home.  Buying online, and through Subscribe and Save with free shipping, not only makes this product less expensive than buying at the grocery store, but far more convenient."
4,"According to my cat, this stuff is just great.  He just licks himself for hours after eating this one and just loves the taste.  He will lick the bowl clean on this one and eats it usually pretty quickly.  But, he still doesn't want it more than 2-3 times a month because it's fish - not exactly his favorite food.  It's a great diversion from his regular fare and one that he truly appreciates."
0,"Rishi Tea Organic Earl Grey Loose Tea will appeal to those wishing a more subtle use of bergamot than other brands that overwhelm the tea drinker with perfumed aroma. Personally, I prefer my Earl Grey to be somewhat more aggressive. The attractive packaging and the fact that the tea is organically grown by farmers who are fairly compensated are pluses.<br /><br />Incidentally, I tried this tea first with no sweetener; and it tastes fine ""straight""; however, because the bergamot is not strong, I found that I preferred it with a sweetener. Honey did not work for me with this tea; however, I found aspertame to work surprisingly well (Aspertame is usually one of my least favorite sweeteners).<br /><br />The brewing instructions are simple and work well.<br /><br />It would be nice to have the option of buying this tea in tea-bag form.<br /><br />To sum up, this tea is a quality product with good taste, from a good source, but otherwise unexceptional."
1,"This drink is very, very sweet, and only mildly carbonated.<br /><br />I don't drink soda, but i do occasionally like bubbles in my drinks. I had some hope that Switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need, but it's not. The ingredients may be all-natural, but it's still syrupy, and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin C.<br /><br />For regular soda drinkers, the sweetness may not be as offensive, but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice, this will be a disappointment. I'd still choose this over an orange soda, but i'd choose to have nothing at all rather than this.<br /><br />Also, note that the cans are only 8.3 ounces each, smaller than normal 12oz soda cans."
1,"First, I do have to say that this juice does NOT look like the picture: it's grayer and more translucent, even after shaking to redistribute the pulp. It won't make pretty mixed drinks. But it is - HANDS DOWN - the *best* tasting pineapple juice I have ever had. And the fact that it's organic and ALL juice, no concentrate or water hijinks, makes me even happier! I will be drinking this juice as long as they keep making it."
3,"We have been drinking Stephen's Candycane Cocoa for several years.  Our Walmart carries it at Christmas time, but they run out fast.  It's the candycane pieces in the cocoa that make it soo good!  You can make it as strong or weak as you like it, by adding more cocoa or more water than the directions say.  I like it a little stronger - it gives it a bold chocolate taste with a strong candycane kick!  I don't know what else to tell you except it is absolutely out of this world!  All you need is a cup, a spoon, hot water, and Stephen's Candycane Cocoa.  You're set, drink up!  Just remember not to use it all up in one setting!<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing I would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can.  It calls for 3 1/2 rounded tablespoons of cocoa mix per 6 ounces of hot water.  When Sara and I make a 12 oz cup each and each have a refill, we can almost kill off one can in a sitting.  (Yes, it IS that good!)  I wish Stephen's could concentrate this or put it up in larger cans.<br /><br />I hope I have helped in your purchasing decision."
4,Got this free with another order I placed.  I couldn't believe how much the cats loved it. I will buy again for sure.
1,"Switch Orange/Tangerine soda comes in a smaller can than a regular soda (a little over 8 ounces, compared to the usual 12 ounces in a regular soft drink can).  It is labeled as ""all-natural"" because the sugars in it come from fruit juices rather than added corn syrup.  I chilled the can of Switch in my refrigerator overnight, and then sampled it poured over ice in a glass.  The color is not so ""neon"" orange as some orange sodas -- it is a softer orange color.  The fizz is also less than in a regular soft drink.<br /><br />I found the flavor pleasing, with none of the chemical or metallic taste which can occur in many brands of orange soda.  The soft fizziness of the drink complemented the orange flavor well.  I didn't really get a true tangerine taste from the soda.  Tangerines are a very acidic fruit, and have a very distinct taste, which I did not really get from this soda.  However, the taste is very smooth and quite refreshing.  My teenaged daughters and their friends loved this soda, and I have been re-ordering it every so often as a treat.<br /><br /> Switch is a bit pricy.  You can cut down on the price by signing up for regular deliveries, but so far I haven't given in to that temptation.  However I am buying it for special occasions, for the travel cooler, and for planned teen get-togethers."
0,"I don't drink soda and have no interest in energy drinks - I love coffee. However, I enjoy chamomile tea before bed. This calming beverage is a great alternative to tea - especially in hot weather. I will be ordering more - wish it were available locally."
0,"I must say I love this Tropical Green tea. I really like the nylon bags, therefore I can see the tea leaves. In my opinion it is a smooth tea unlike most green teas.  I initially purchased at a local store and now it's not sold there anymore.  I decided to find it online and Thank goodness Amazon has it.  Hoooray ! Keep up the good work Amazon!"
0,"For any Tea lover, (we became fans in England) Ahmad Tea pleases immensely. I/we have sampled tea from quite a few vendors but after our son brought a pack of Ahmad Tea back with him (from Jolly Old..) as a gift, we were sold. We found the flavor splendid. We loved it. It is fully flavored and needs NO sugar/milk/sweetener at all. (And I usually needed sweeteners with the other brands of Earl Grey, so...)<br />Buying it from Amazon is a very economical solution and delivery was expediant. I HIGHLY recommend, if you enjoy hot tea, try this brand!<br />MAC,<br />Please excuse any spelling errors, that may have occurred in my haste, and NO spell-check help. Heheheh. Ta-ta. ""Earl Grey..hot"". JLP"
1,"Overall the drink was decent. It's tart and sweet at the same time. Switch is alright but might not be worth the money depending on how much you like it. I myself would prefer a Spicy V8 over this. It might be a good substitute for some who don't want to drink as much soda, but for me i'll just stick with the v8 and the occasional soda."
0,"I thought I'd be writing a review raving about this product.  Sadly, I'm not.<br />I would never use it for home use.  It tasted ""muddy"" and bitter. I followed the directions. I even made sure the water was hot but not boiling. I'd probably take it backbacking, but that's it. It's worth a try if you haven't tasted it yet. Read some of the other neutral reviews.  It might help with expectations."
0,"The pear infusion doesn't knock you over the head. It's a subtle and soothing tea that is drinkable throughout my work day. Looking for something a bit different, go for this."
4,My one year old cat ate a few of these and seemed lethargic.  Two weeks later I gave him a large helping of these<br />and I thought he was going to die.  He laid around and would not eat or move for two days.  I will not feed him these<br />again.  Same thing happened to my parent's cat after eating the salmon variety.
0,"If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for ""White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,"" ""Green Tea Papaya Nectar"" and ""Green Tea Sugar Cookies."" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
3,We discovered a cafe that had excellent Mexican mochas about three years ago. They were expensive but we didn't visit that often. Then we discovered this was the powder used to make the mochas. It is all natural and tastes great. It is really rich and has nice spicy undertones. This is the cheapest way to purchase it in bulk.<br /><br />Now we make our mochas at home with an espresso machine and steamed milk. This also is loved by our children for hot chocolate.
2,"Got three different Amish popcorn's for my daughter's Birthday..she is always on a diet, I got her the hot air popper same time...she & my grandson..( he's 4) loved it..she ate a bowl every night &  still lost 15 lbs !! not saying it's a diet food, just satisfiing !!"
4,"This one is a great basic food. Whatever is in it, cats really go for and mine is no exception.  My current cat really doesn't like the ground variety which is what this is.  He will eat it occasionally, so I only buy it about twice a year.  My previous cat had to have it more often and really enjoyed it.  It's hard to judge what a cat will eat so if your cat likes ground, give this one a go because it really seems to be a big favorite."
2,"Was so disappointed to discover that HappyBaby changed Super Salmon!  My little girl LOVED the old formula, and it had more protein and calories than this new version.  The new version also has more sugar and sodium than the previous version, and it has a completely different taste and texture - she won't touch it.  We will not be buying it again."
0,Calms VERY WELL.  Tastes great with honey but that's a personal choice.  Best stuff!  Can't wait to try their other teas!
3,"This is simply the best chocolate I have ever tried. In general, 3kg packages are much better than 70g Valrhona's. If I had only tried 70g Valrhona Manjari, I would have never known how good it can be. Try the 70g to see which one you like and then buy 3kg package(it will be 3 times better). It has around one year of best before left when you buy it(which is enough, beleive me)...<br /><br />Great for cooking and sublime for eating."
1,"Carbonated juice is exactly what this drink is.  Even though there's no sugar added, it's still very sweet, which makes me think that any health benefits it has is overwhelmed by the sugar content.  Also, I don't think the amount you get (teeny bit more than a cup) is fair for how much the product costs.  Stick with real fruit.  This is basically sweetly flavored sparkling water."
2,"We love the Earth's Best line in our house. Our 9 mo old daughter  will ONLY eat Earth's Best dinners, and I don't blame her. The smell from both of the other 2 brand was nauseating. I've sampled the Earth's best dinners myself, and they aren't half bad... It is baby food.... The fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well."
